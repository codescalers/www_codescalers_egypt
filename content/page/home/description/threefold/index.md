We are currently working with THREEFOLD to build an open-source peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure. This removes all forms of centralization from the global IT systems, where independent people can connect Nodes (powered by our decentralized stateless and lightweight OS) to the ThreeFold Grid anywhere electricity and network is present. And Together, they form a globally decentralized, distributed and green Internet infrastructure.
