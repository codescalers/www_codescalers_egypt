          The internet is growing at an extremely fast pace, but is that a good thing?
        </p>
        
        <div class="article hidden"><p><em>This article was originally published by Andreas Hartl, a former member of the ThreeFold team.</em></p>
<br>
<p>The current growth of internet needs 4000+ new large scale data centers of computer systems. The global data growth will reach more than 40 Zetabytes by 2020 which represents an average yearly growth of 42% starting at 4.5 Zetabytes in 2013. To host all this data, over 4000 new big data centers have to to be built. And to achieve this goal, $ 1 trillion USD investment capital is needed and land totalling the size of the UK would be needed.
<br/>
<br/>
The Internet is one of the fastest growing industries in the world. In this article we’ll explain why that’s not always such a good thing and where we see opportunities.</p>
<h2 id="internet-capacity-needs-to-become-localized">Internet capacity needs to become localized</h2>
<p>A big majority of users in the world connect to servers that are not present in their region and as such experience higher costs and low performance. According to a study by datacentermap.com, 80% of the data centers of the current Internet’s service providers are based in the U.S. and Europe. The rest of the world has scarce Internet resources dotted around territories.
<br/>
<br/>
As a consequence most Internet users use Internet-based services running on infrastructure which is located far away from their physical location and most likely outside their country’s borders. This decreases the general end-user experience (latency) but also adds unnecessary costs to transporting the information back and forth. Also, it adds legislation and compliance headaches to enterprises.
<br/>
<br/>
Our mission is to empower and inspire people to recognize abundance by living new experiences one hour at a time.</p>
<h2 id="the-internet-needs-to-perform-better">The Internet needs to perform better</h2>
<p>Compute and Storage vendors create poor-performing solutions. There have been yearly improvements in hardware following Moore’s law. While this has allowed ThreeFold to progress and innovate, it has also led to software developers taking these advances for granted; cutting corners where they can, creating sub-optimal code and allowing software components to be layered on top of each other to achieve certain behavioral functionalities.
<br/>
<br/>
The inefficiencies have now led to a situation where organically-grown IT architectures are immensely complex. They use a variety of components from different software and hardware vendors integrated by so called ‘integrators’. The overall effort and cost involved to create, operate and maintain such architectures is growing continuously and requiring an ever-increasing budget and resourcing to continue.
<br/>
<br/>
If we could go down to the core algorithms and take another look at these, and innovate at the heart of technology instead of applying patches and pain killers, we would be able to create much more end-user capacity than what systems provide today. Systems will last longer and will not have to be replaced by faster ones. Also, fewer engineers will be needed to create, operate and maintain these systems. Combined, these elements would present a more stable and reliable platform that can achieve higher levels of uptime.
<br/>
<br/>
Only upsides, right? Well a huge downside of such an approach is that vendors will make less revenue and more importantly less margin as systems will run for longer, be more stable and require less updates. So why would vendors innovate at the core of their solution?</p>
<h2 id="the-internet-needs-to-become-more-sustainable">The Internet needs to become more sustainable</h2>
<p>Did you know that the current Internet is responsible for between 5 and 10% of global energy consumptions? Making it more harmful to our planet than the airline Industry. The good news is that we can achieve 10x more power efficiency by addressing certain areas such as storage.
<br/>
<br/>
ThreeFold believes IT can do a much better job at being more sustainable - in fact ThreeFold believes it can reduce the Internet’s carbon footprint by 10 times compared to other industry standards in IT capacity producing solutions.
<br/>
<br/>
Power consumption is a function of better compute and storage performance that in theory would require more racks and cooling. ThreeFold’s architectural approach brought solutions that enables it’s Farmers to achieve roughly 3 times the performance per rack (so it uses fewer racks) and the racks require less energy than typical racks in the industry.

<h2 id="the-internet-needs-to-become-more-affordable">The Internet needs to become more affordable</h2>
<p>The biggest cost in running IT architectures is the human cost. Today’s complex systems, built out of ‘band aid and patches’ point solutions, organically-grown and badly documented IT infrastructures, need an armada of people to keep them ticking. Even though this is an example, one can learn a lot from the trends that are presented:
<br/>
<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>On average an IT budget takes 5% of overall revenues</li>
<li>IT consumes 6.5% of the total number of Full-time equivalent in the company, of which 85% are insourced and 15% on payroll. This means that the enterprise doesn’t retain internal know-how to operate their IT.</li>
<li>About 50% of IT budgets are spent on Infrastructure ane operations. Similarly, a big part goes to applications. A mere 5% is considered to be internal overhead within the IT department.</li>
<li>Around 65% of the IT budget is spent on resources and services, around 35% is spent on hardware and software.
<br/>
<br/>
These figures present industry average numbers and paint a troubling picture that IT is a sizeable part of an overall budget, and that most spending is going to have the right knowledge skills insourced to the organisation to run the core IT architecture it relies on. For any other discipline in any organisation this would present an unacceptable risk to the business and its continuity - strangely not for IT.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-internet-needs-to-become-self-healing">The Internet needs to become self-healing</h2>
<p>The biggest source of downtime in computer systems is people. Getting people involved in fixing infrastructure problems creates the risk of accidentally causing more system downtime. A very recent example on this hit a large organisation cloud service provider.
<br/>
<br/>
20+ years ago when Internet data centers came into existence next to telecom points of presence (POP), the level of complication in architecting, and building and maintaining these infrastructures exploded. From an already reasonable complicated technology setup to transport packets of data around the globe, these information warehouses were created where data was uploaded to, processed, and the obtained results sent back to end users on the other side of the globe.
<br/>
<br/>
Managing a data center that contains solutions for information transportation, storage and processing is not an easy task and the growth of data volume uploaded, stored and processed has exponentially increased. The number of technologies invented and implemented in regards to the processing and storing of information has also exploded. This resulted in a double exponential growth in complexity to architect, build, operate and maintain these IT systems.
<br/>
<br/>
The time has come that we no longer rely on people to do the right thing in case of emergency - the complexity is overwhelming and the dependency on the availability of that information is huge. Having people to do manual deployments and operational responsibilities does not provide the agility and speed to keep up with the continuous exponential growth of the industry. It is time to take the human element out of IT and let smart and autonomous systems to take over. This will also let people focus on more creative activities.</p>
<h2 id="the-world-needs-a-responsible-internet">The world needs a responsible internet</h2>
<p>On a humanitarian level the opportunities for creativity, learning and development are currently negatively influenced by a lack of access to performant and affordable Internet services. Since <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/un-says-internet-access-is-a-human-right-2016-7#:~:text=Due%20to%20the%20lack%20of,20.">Internet access is a human right</a>, it should protect the status quo between the developed and less-developed regions of our world.</p>
<h2 id="the-internet-is-growing-fast-with-the-wrong-solutions">The Internet is growing fast, with the wrong solutions</h2>
<p>It is evident that the current solutions are super unsustainable and make no sense. Luckily, ThreeFold and many other start-ups are deploying new solutions.

<h3 id="any-docker-service">Any Docker Service</h3>
<p>ThreeFold nodes natively run containers - therefore they can run any Docker service.  But it does so in a more efficient way than the current Docker engine - the most used and known container technology platform in the world.</p>
<h3 id="iaas">IAAS</h3>
<p>The ThreeFold node technology enables hardware capabilities to be used for IAAS services in a very efficient way.  Overhead is reduced to a minimum by stripping out unnecessary layers of software that have been implemented over the last decade to patch scaling and performance problems. Our engineers have always looked at the root cause of issues and by innovating at the core algorithm level, solved many issues.
Examples are:
<br/>
<br/></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Less is more</strong>: Scale down the operating system for a virtualization architecture to a minimum and boot it over the network - no local operating system files installed on local storage.</li>
<li><strong>Look at root causes, no painkiller approach</strong>: Step away from existing storage solutions that require proprietary acceleration hardware and use standard off the shelf, affordable and efficient components with a 100% software-based storage solution that can withstand hardware failures without requiring human intervention - creating a very efficient, reliable and performing storage solution that can operate standalone.
<br/>
<br/>
The platform is secured by using a network boot mechanism that makes it virtually hack resistant as there are no operating system files installed locally. Infrastructure as a service traditionally runs in hyper-scale data centers, remote from the businesses using it. ThreeFold node technology allows you to install, operate and run IAAS services close to your business locations operated by your local IT team.  It operates on a peer-to-peer network - only transferring bits of data that need to be transported to avoid network congestion and traffic bottlenecks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="archive">Archive</h3>
<p>Data generation is growing exponentially. More data has been generated in the last 2 years than ever before. This creates a big need to archive data. The ThreeFold node technology creates storage and archiving capabilities by using standard hardware and known interfaces (S3, FTP, WebDav, CIFS, and NFS) will be built by developers worldwide and made available.  The low-level storage functionality supports version controlling of the archived data, which keeps all relevant changes without any limitation by using a small amount of actual storage capacity.</p>
<h3 id="security">Security</h3>
<p>Data security and reliability are key aspects of any storage system.  The ThreeFold node allows all data to be compressed and encrypted if and when needed. The distributed character of the storage system enables site redundant storage algorithms to be deployed while keeping large data volumes from being stored in a single location. This removes the risk of data being stolen (physically) and prevents a site outage to result in data outage.  The distributed character of the system is in line with the increasing spread of actual data generation.  ThreeFold has sensory equipment everywhere these days, and the overhead of storing all that information in a few central places is enormous. Data collection and storage happens once - reading data to use it for a particular workload happens many times.</p>
<h3 id="data-mining">Data Mining</h3>
<p>On traditional server architectures, every application has to set up its servers that run their code in isolated silos, making sharing of data hard. The distributed character of the ThreeFold node technology presents compute and storage capacity everywhere.  This enables large data mining workloads to happen close to the source of the data.  By storing data in a distributed manner, mining can be distributed as well. Distributed compute capacity next to storage capabilities creates the possibility to create data mining operations on local storage (which makes it very fast and efficient) by coding data mining algorithms in programming languages (such as Python, Lua, Javascript, and Golang). Data mining follows distributed data storage.
<br/>
<br/>
Never run into scalability problems again with the ThreeFold node. Data storage can expand horizontally using thousands of distributed nodes to create large storage volumes.</p>
<h3 id="smart-contracts">Smart Contracts</h3>
<p>Smart contracts are applications that run on a decentralized platform, exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party interference. These applications run on a blockchain, a powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of that value. Smart contracts enable developers to create markets, store registries of debts (or promises), move funds following past instructions (like a will or a futures contract), and many other things without a middleman or counterparty risk.  ThreeFold nodes run based on smart-contracts.</p>
<h3 id="self-learning-and-ai">Self-Learning and AI</h3>
<p>Blockchains can be seen as databases. By current database standards, traditional blockchains like Bitcoin are terrible: low throughout, low capacity, high latency, poor query support, and so on. But even with these terrible characteristics, blockchains introduced three new and important characteristics:
<br/>
<br/></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decentralized data and shared data control</strong>  leads to more data and better qualitative data which results in better models. Shortening the machine learning time also enables AI to progress at a faster pace.</li>
<li><strong>Immutable audit trails</strong> improve the trustworthiness of the data, and improves the models’ provenance on training and testing results.</li>
<li><strong>Native assets</strong> and assets exchanges make training and testing models intellectual property (IP) assets easier - enhancing decentralized data and model exchanges.
<br/>
<br/>
Blockchain technology allows more and better quality data to be presented to machine learning algorithms.  It has been proven (Microsoft researchers - Banko and Brill) that more data — not just a bit more data but way more data — while using the same algorithms results in a lot better machine learning.  Meaning that the future of machine learning is not in trying to create more sophisticated algorithms (which will happen). So by moving AI learning into a blockchain environment we speed up machine learning and in the end create AI.</li>

<h2 id="edge-computing-definition">Edge Computing Definition</h2>
<p>According to Wikipedia, “<strong>Edge computing</strong> is a distributed computing paradigm in which computation is largely or entirely performed on distributed device nodes known as smart devices or edge devices as opposed to primarily taking place in a centralized cloud environment.</p>
<br>
<p>In summary, this means that the cloud is divided into smaller pieces and distributed to the edge of the network.</p>
<h2 id="drivers-for-edge-computing">Drivers for Edge Computing</h2>
<p>Some latency-sensitive applications require fast response times to work correctly. A good example is self-driving cars. A lot of decisions in autonomous vehicles have to be made instantaneously; the decision to react to the unexpected while driving at high speed cannot afford to be slowed down by data traveling long distances to be processed. To improve the system’s reliability, additional hops, and any further points of failure must be eliminated. Moving to compute as far out as possible to the Edge is the logical choice.</p>
<br>
<p>More generically, real-world situations are increasingly relying on an IT component to be involved in some form of decision making where time is of the essence.  The current IT setup is that we have highly concentrated IT setups in data centers connected by fast networks to the rest of the world. This setup is rapidly becoming obsolete as we need to have the fastest possible response for everyday activities, which cannot sustain the time delay caused by (extended) network connections.  Having actual data processing and storage facilities close to these real-world situations is the next IT capacity evolution.</p>
<br>
<p>These thousands of situations are mostly in the IoT area. Still, other killer applications like streaming would greatly benefit from being served from the Edge rather than a distant central location.</p>
<h2 id="edge-computing-market-facts">Edge Computing Market Facts</h2>
<p>Due to the billions of IoT devices driven by various use cases like autonomous driving,  a massive demand for Edge Computing is evolving rapidly. According to the Digital Journal, the Edge Computing market is growing extremely fast. With a  CAGR of over 35.0% and the market is expected to reach  USD 33.75 billion by the end of 2023.

<br/>
<br/>
Edge Computing and Grid Computing are often used in the same context and sometimes are confused. For this article, we’d like to define the terms going forward as follows:
<br/>
<br/>
Grid Computing means a computer network of 100% distributed computer resources like processing power, memory, and data storage of similar or different types to which authorized people can run their computation workloads. That means that Grid Compute nodes are mostly in data centers and maybe dispersed over more extensive regions but are typically still far from the Edge. Compared to Edge Computing,  Grid Computing environments are owned by more than one individual or company, and thus, controlled by many.
<br/>
<br/>
Edge computing has risen from a need to have data processing and storage as close as possible to real-world situations.  The situation could be as simple as recording biometric data by a smartwatch to support the required information for a self-driving car to function as intended.  The necessity comes from having local computing and storage capacity - it can be used by multiple use cases (situations) but does not have to.</p>
<h2 id="the-benefits-of-edge-computing">The Benefits of Edge Computing</h2>
<p>Edge computing comes with specific benefits that are mandatory for the next evolution in the IT industry.  We have optimized the central model to such a degree that the network connects the central capacity to use cases in the field, the next bottleneck.  Edge computing is solving several challenges faced by real-world situations with the following benefits:</p>
<h3 id="speed">Speed</h3>
<p><strong>Speed</strong> is probably the most crucial benefit of edge computing, as there are plenty of use cases that require near-real-time computing.</p>
<h3 id="scalability">Scalability</h3>
<p>The scalability of edge computing also makes it incredibly <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.vxchnge.com/blog/edge-computing-use-cases">versatile</a>. By partnering with local data centers further out on the Edge, companies can easily target desirable markets without investing in expensive infrastructure expansion. Edge data centers allow them to service end-users efficiently with little physical distance or latency. They also do not constrain companies with a substantial footprint, allowing them to shift to other markets rapidly should economic conditions change.</p>
<h3 id="availability-and-security">Availability and Security</h3>
<p>Traditional cloud computing architecture is, by definition, centralized, which makes it especially vulnerable to <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.vxchnge.com/blog/how-to-protect-data-centers-from-a-new-generation-of-ddos-attacks">distributed denial of service (DDoS)</a> attacks and power outages. Edge computing distributes processing, storage, and applications across a wide range of devices, nodes and data centers, which makes it difficult for any single disruption to take down the network which is why logically and geographically dispersed systems are often used for DDoS mitigation like in Content Delivery Networks (CDN)
<br/>
<br/>
By pushing everything to the cloud, you’re leaving your business open to ISP failures and cloud server downtime. Many mission-critical operations like railroads and chemical plants won’t even use the cloud today. Their server farms are the only way to guarantee uptime.</p>
<h3 id="process-optimisation">Process optimisation</h3>
<p>Another big benefit is process optimization. If self-driving cars were to use the cloud instead of the Edge, they’d be pushing all the data they gather up to the cloud. But if the Edge makes local decisions, the cloud may not need all that data immediately – or even at all.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-for-edge-computing">Requirements for Edge Computing</h2>
<p>When compute and storage capabilities exist on the Edge, we need to overcome several challenges around capacity distribution.  Most traditional IT technologies do not allow this as they live in large data centers where there is a lot of “care” for these technologies.
<br/>
<br/>
The most significant generic hurdle to overcome is that there is going to be a lot less “care” for the technology to rely on at the Edge.  These “devices” have to be self-sufficient to no small degree.  If we want to sum up some of the specifics of edge technology, this will come out:
<br/>
<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>A typical edge device or node must run an OS that comes in at a low cost or, ideally, for free like some open source offerings. This enhances the proliferation of capacity at the Edge.</li>
<li>Container technology must be embedded in the OS at the lowest possible level to create the maximum benefit of efficiency from the edge hardware: classic Virtual Machine environments are just too inefficient and resource consuming for edge use cases. There will be Virtual Machine based edge solutions, but these are going to be out there for a certain period, catering for current IT workloads to move to the Edge.  The Edge’s correct move can only happen when traditional IT applications split up into pieces and require a lot less capacity to run.  Hence, it will convert over time to containerized technology.</li>
<li>Edge Computing hardware will consist of datacenter grade hardware and all sorts of other types of hardware.  The Edge might include some smaller sized data center facilities but also include different types of “homes” for compute and storage equipment.  Think of transportation as a specific use case - capacity on maritime vessels, capacity on trains, and vehicles’ capacity.  Hardware will have to accommodate different use cases,  price levels, form factors, and power consumption.</li>
<li>Edge hardware needs a lightweight OS that is very close to the hardware components to get the maximum out of compute and storage capacity.  Less is more - for real Edge capacity, local people won’t be able to interact with edge capacity - one further step - there will be no need to have remote people access these devices for maintenance purposes.  The ultimate edge computing solution will have a significant amount of self-sustainability - where there are no more highly technically skilled people required to keep the capacity available, up and running.</li>
<li>In most cases, Edge means being remote, and having no access to humans or humans are only too expensive for the specific use case.</li>
<li>Power outages or no network availability will cause system failures. The ideal OS to deal with this revolves around no people; the zero-touch approach should be stateless and needs to have self-healing capabilities run by automation software robots.<br /></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="existing-edge-computing-solutions">Existing Edge Computing Solutions</h2>
<p>Today there are a few Edge Computing platforms out there that cover some requirements as outlined above.
<br/>
<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft, for instance, launched products like Azure IoT Edge and Azure Data Box Edge to extend their Datacenter based Azure cloud offering to the Edge.</li>
<li>Another attempt to bring centralized cloud technology to the Edge is the Openstack Edge Computing initiative, which is in the concept phase only so far.</li>
<li>A new OS for the Edge is CoreOs, also known as Container Linux, which runs on nearly any platform, whether physical, virtual, or private/public cloud.</li>
<li>More recently, there are a few blockchain-driven technologies out there pushing for edge capacity to exist.  Examples are:
<ul>
<li><a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://sia.tech/">SIA</a></li>
<li><a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://sonm.com/">Sonm</a></li>
<li><a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Content delivery networks with a lot of “capacity” sitting close to end-users are expanding their capabilities beyond content delivery
<ul>
<li><a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.limelight.com/products/iot-and-edge-cloud/">Limelight</a></li>
<li><a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.akamai.com/">Akamai</a><br />
<br/>
<br/></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-holy-grail">The Holy Grail</h2>
<p>The holy grail would be a self-healing Edge Grid. Edge, because of all the benefits Edge Computing brings to the user: Speed, Scalability, Reliability, Security, Versatility, and Process Optimization. Grid, because it fulfills the distributed workload requirements, a classic centralized cloud would generally be used without a centralized nature and all its disadvantages.
<br/>
<br/>
Probably the most critical part of the ideal solution is self-healing. The biggest challenge of an Edge Computing environment is the dependency on local care: humans to maintain hardware and upgrade or fix software components. Self Healing needs to do the job here, which means zero people can be involved.
<br/>
<br/>
Only a self-healing mechanism with zero-people involved, completely decentralized, brings down the cost and provides more security to the environment, and makes it highly scalable.
<br/>
<br/>
Some of you may think that new blockchain-based technologies may be the holy grail. But they are not.
<br/>
<br/>
In most cases, their implementations are too slow, and that’s why it does not make sense to use them for production purposes. Another downside is the complexity of the application caused by stitching together 3rd party technologies. In many cases, these blockchain-based technologies are at a very early stage with beta implementations or even roadmap only type of technology.
<br/>
<br/>
The holy grail is something that hasn’t been created before; it needs to be a versatile system that is self-manageable.  A large global conglomerate should not own the capacity - it should be owned by many. Therefore, it should have a commercial model where people individually can decide to partake in building this global edge solution and where there is a defined return on investment for those partakers.
<br/>
<br/>
A few groups of people, like us, are creating decentralized solutions for this, owned by the many, and creating services for all.</p>

        <p class="mt-3 text-sm font-normal text-gray-500 text-left">
          The Edge internet needs a different approach. So, we started as from scratch and shaped a totally new approach..

        <div class="article hidden"><h2 id="threefold-s-technology-does-not-follow-the-traditional-it-model">ThreeFold’s technology does not follow the traditional IT model</h2>
<p>The Edge internet needs a different approach. So, we started from scratch and shaped a new approach. ThreeFold’s open-source technology addresses the scalability, security, storage, energy, and operating issues by simplifying architectures and not relying on third-party software. This drives down costs and improves efficiencies.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-threefold-s-technology-toolbox">What is ThreeFold’s Technology Toolbox?</h2>
<p>ThreeFold’s technology is based on three primary building blocks:  Stateless Computing, Self-Healing Technology, and Blockchain technology - this is the core of our “Technology Toolbox“.
<br/>
<br/></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stateless Computing</strong>: a stateless operating system, Zero-OS, enabling distributed hardware to form an Edge Internet grid generating IT storage and compute capacity</li>
<li><strong>Self-Healing Technology</strong>: controls and operates a distributed cloud and reserves, procures, and executes workloads on the grid using our Jumpscale platform. It delivers autoscaling and automation frameworks that enable self-healing and can be adapted for any kind of IT workload.</li>
<li><strong>Blockchain Technology</strong>: Via Rivine - our secure, scalable “proof of stake” blockchain, along with our identity management platform, ItsYou.online. Our blockchain technology enables user authentication, access controls, secure workloads, and heightened security.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="enabling-stateless-computing">Enabling Stateless Computing</h2>
<p>The global decentralized internet will be composed of thousands (millions?) of nodes distributed geographically.  This means the decentralized internet must be powered by a stateless operating system that can be booted via the Internet (as opposed to living on the node locally). This removes the complexity of upgrades, truck rolls, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Open-source components have been developed, Zero-OS, for the deployment of bare metal machines functioning as Internet nodes and application hosts.  Our Zero-OS platform runs containerized applications and software code on secure and distributed IT infrastructure.  Zero-OS can be deployed on off-the-shelf hardware by anyone willing to make server and storage capacity available in their markets and within our network.</p>
<h3 id="the-benefits-of-stateless-computing-are-substantial-including">The benefits of Stateless Computing are substantial, including:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: lightweight OS without overhead for running bare-metal machines.</li>
<li><strong>Free</strong>: finds the optimal performance of server &amp; storage nodes at no cost.</li>
<li><strong>Private</strong>: no data footprint remains while workloads move from one node to another.</li>
<li><strong>Distributed</strong>: capacity is generated without the need for data centers: At The Edge.</li>
<li><strong>High-available</strong>: easy creation of clusters while applications run in fragmented segments.</li>
<li><strong>Portability</strong>: moving software from one node to another within the grid is instant.</li>
<li><strong>Secure</strong>: open-source distributed software with transparent code. No security backdoors</li>
<li><strong>Sustainable</strong>: energy-efficient OS resulting in very low node power consumption.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technology-that-is-self-healing-self-driving">Technology that is self-healing &amp; self-driving</h2>
<p>ThreeFold’s Jumpscale framework and ZeroBot allow the creation of blueprints to auto-deploy applications within the compute environment. The bots are constantly checking the health and uptime of the infrastructure, and runtime environments, to guarantee the performance and availability of applications at all times.</p>
<h3 id="the-benefits-of-our-self-healing-technology-protocols-include-the-following">The benefits of our self-healing technology protocols include the following:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-Healing</strong>: the platform regenerates when health issues that cause downtime for infrastructure and applications are detected.</li>
<li><strong>Intelligence</strong>: agents capture information from the grid and make intelligent decisions to provide an ideal and optimal host environment for software code and containerized applications.</li>
<li><strong>Lifecycle Management</strong>: the status of the infrastructure and the lifecycle of running applications are constantly checked and recorded.</li>
<li><strong>Autoscaling</strong>: the platform automatically scales to meet application and infrastructure performance.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="blockchain-technology-to-execute-workloads-and-applications-via-smart-contracts">Blockchain Technology to execute workloads and applications via smart contracts</h2>
<p>The engineers developed new blockchain algorithms based on proof of stake for validation purposes and turned this into our Rivine open-source blockchain software.
<br/>
<br/>
Unlike the “proof of work” blockchains that currently dominate the space, our Rivine blockchain is scalable, green, and secure - and does not rely on huge mining resources.  We run our blockchain on approximately 200 dedicated nodes and do not rely on any third-party software.
<br/>
<br/>
In addition to our blockchain technology, we have also developed ItsYou.Online, an identity, and access management platform.  Itsyou. online uses three-factor authentication to manage access on our network and facilitate execution.</p>
<h3 id="the-benefits-of-tf-blockchain-technology-and-identity-management-platform-include">The benefits of TF blockchain technology and identity management platform include:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sustainable</strong>: our algorithms to reach consensus use a minimal amount of energy and electricity compared to other blockchain software and networks.</li>
<li><strong>Lowest possible cost</strong>: of transactions make it an efficient and fast payment system.</li>
<li><strong>Neutral</strong>: state of the network and applications are recorded in a transparent and immutable manner.</li>
<li><strong>Payment fulfillment</strong>: transactions are automatically paid using ThreeFold Tokens.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Contracts</strong>: fully automated execution of contracts from customers buying Internet IT capacity.

        <div class="article hidden"><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Blockchain technology has the power to change the world of IT. There are a huge number of new initiatives using blockchain technology around the world, with countless use cases.
<br/>
<br/>
In general, there are two types of blockchains: proof of work blockchains and proof of stake blockchains. They are consensus algorithms on how transactions are verified and added to the ledger (forever, as blockchains provide an immutable record of events). More on these two types of blockchains below.</p>
<h2 id="blockchain-basics">Blockchain Basics</h2>
<p>A blockchain is, as the word says, a chain of blocks of information. These “blocks” contain information on transactions. For instance transactions like the transfer of value of a digital currency (token) from wallet A to wallet B. The “chain” aspect comes when part of the information is stored in a block as a link to the previous block (a unique number). This is a very simple representation of what a blockchain is.</p>
<h2 id="private-permissioned-or-public-blockchains">Private, Permissioned or Public Blockchains</h2>
<p>The complexity around a blockchain comes from how the blockchain software is run. The software can run in two different ways: a small (or large) number of nodes controlled by one single entity (private blockchain) a person or a company, or a large (or small) number of nodes controlled by multiple entities (public) that do not know each other and where anyone interested to run a blockchain node can join.
<br/>
<br/>
By running blockchain software under the supervision of one entity (private, centralized) you can quite easily make sure the information stored in the blockchain (transactions) are not tempered with by only operating a small number of nodes and deploying them in very safe physical locations (private data-centers, vaults, basements of offices, etc). A private blockchain does not allow unknown entities to join and run the blockchain software.
<br/>
<br/>
A permissioned blockchain is operated by known entities such as stakeholders of a given industry. It is a mix of both private and public blockchains. In this type of blockchain network, a participant may not need permission to join the network but needs permission to transact with another network participant.
<br/>
<br/>
A public blockchain allows anyone to join the blockchain operation and create a new blockchain node. The blockchain is run by multiple entities (decentralized, public) that have no relationship nor knowledge about each other
<br/>
<br/>
For these three types of blockchains, there are different mechanisms to protect and guarantee the validity of transactions and make them tamper-proof.</p>
<h2 id="private-data-and-anonymous-or-pseudo-anonymous-data">Private Data and Anonymous or Pseudo-Anonymous Data?</h2>
<p>For private blockchains, it is straightforward to see that all data that is stored on private blockchains is private and creates 100% anonymity for its users. The only entity or person that has access to information stored on the blockchain is the blockchain operator. This is comparable to how a bank operates. The bank knows everything about all of its customers and the customers only know about themselves - the non-bank customers do not know a thing.
<br/>
<br/>
On a public blockchain, people can join and operate a blockchain node on which all information of that blockchain is stored. While private blockchains get their security from putting their blockchain nodes in secure buildings operated by trusted people a public blockchain achieves its security from having a large number of nodes that have the same data replicated over and over. A consensus algorithm is required in order to accept new data (new blocks) to the chain.</p>
<h2 id="consensus-protocols-for-public-blockchains">Consensus Protocols for Public Blockchains</h2>
<p>The main consensus protocols used today are Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake.</p>
<h3 id="proof-of-work-high-cost-in-compute-and-energy">Proof of Work (High Cost in Compute and Energy)</h3>
<p>The proof of work consensus protocol is best explained as a race. The consensus is achieved by having all participating nodes solve a puzzle. The puzzle is a one-way translation of an amount of information consisting of the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the data that present the transactions in the block - all the data is known by all participating nodes</li>
<li>The number of the previous block. Remember a blockchain links blocks of information together.</li>
<li>A (variable) number. This number is the part that can be changed.
<br/>
<br/>
The “work” is done by changing the variable number and see what the translation of all data brings. The translation of all this data is a new number, and the requirement is that that number needs to be smaller than what is known as the “difficulty level”. The difficulty level number has a fixed amount of numbers but when the first digits of the number are zero the overall number is lower. So a higher difficulty is built by having a number that has more zeros at the start in the difficulty number.
<br/>
<br/>
Once the block is completed, all nodes will get the complete block of transactional data, everyone knows the previous block number and will start to change the variable number to get output from the puzzle algorithms comparing it to the required difficulty level.
<br/>
<br/>
The node that will find the number first will announce that it has found a solution matching the required difficulty level and the variable number of shared with all nodes in the network to verify that his solution is correct. If a large portion of the nodes has verified the solution to be valid the solution is accepted and the block is added to the chain because consensus is reached.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="proof-of-block-stake-low-cost-in-compute-and-energy">Proof of (Block) Stake (Low Cost in Compute and Energy)</h3>
<p>With proof of stake consensus algorithms, the consensus algorithm does not solve puzzles in a race to be the first. The first step is to identify and allow a certain number of nodes to be part of the blockchain. This is called a permissioned blockchain because you need to have permission to partake. This permission is given by distributing stakes.
<br/>
<br/>
Proof of Stake consensus mechanism is solving a puzzle, but the puzzle contains only static elements - not variables - based on different characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The block number</li>
<li>The content (part) of blocks a long time ago (&gt;2000 blocks)</li>
<li>The transaction number (between the first and the last transaction) in the block of the stake transfer transaction all participating nodes needs to</li>
<li>The current timestamp
<br/>
<br/>
All these numbers are fixed but the time stamp and every node in the block stake blockchain will solve this puzzle every second until the output of this puzzle matches the required difficulty level.
<br/>
<br/>
To make sure the one node that has solved the puzzle to match the difficulty level cannot introduce information in the block which allows him to tamper with the next blocks this node cannot use his used stake for a period amount of time for creating new blocks.
<br/>
<br/>
The fact that the puzzle-solving includes historic block data and once a node is assigned to create the block and put it on a chain will not be able to use that block state for a period of time makes it very costly to try to tamper with the content of the block (and the next blocks).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-blockchain-dilemma-problem">The Blockchain Dilemma Problem</h2>
<p>Public and private blockchains have their specific advantages and disadvantages and are very good for specific use cases - but not all. If we list the specifics of both we end up with a table like this:
<br/>
<br/></p>
<table><thead><tr><th>*</th><th>Public Blockchains</th><th>Private Blockchains</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Security</td><td>Provided by having a large number of nodes running it</td><td>Provided by having them in secure controlled places</td></tr>

<tr><td><br/></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><br/></td><td></td><td></td></tr>

<ul>
<li><strong>Zero-OS</strong>: A (simple) operating system that does not allow local and remote logins - a closed operating system that receives instructions to launch or kill applications.  This operating system  needs to be stateless to keep as simple as possible:</li>
<li><strong>3Bot</strong>: A virtual system administrator that is able to perform system administration tasks to make the system operate, self-heal and execute instructions from authenticated and authorized sources.</li>
<li><strong>Zero-Chain</strong>: A ledger or database to store information with regards to authentication, operational and financial transactions.
<br/>
<br/>
This system architecture allows for authenticated and trusted virtual system administrators to download, compile and deploy software on a grid of secure Zero-OS nodes with an immutable ledger that records all transactions, operational and financial. This presents a platform on which a public (permissioned) blockchain can be run securely without requiring trusted people to operate the nodes.
<br/>
<br/>
In such architecture, we can build and deploy a high-performance secure blockchain which are the combined benefits of a public and private blockchain.</li>

<h2 id="hyperscale-realities-are-very-different-from-what-most-people-think">Hyperscale realities are very different from what most people think</h2>
<h3 id="myth-1-bigger-data-centers-are-more-efficient">Myth 1: Bigger data centers are more efficient</h3>
<p>There are advantages in building larger-scale data centers, like economies of scale and sheer bulk buying power, but these are not as significant as what people think. The average cost per rack in a hyper-scale data center is $20-35K USD including all energy requirements and safety systems. The cost of hardware per rack is around the $200-300K USD mark.
<br/>
<br/>
What is often forgotten is that anything that is of enormous scale and highly concentrated comes with complexity and specific problems to deal with. For example. resource requirements such as investment, operational costs, knowledge, and people increase significantly with size.
<br/>
<br/>
In reality, keeping things simple, small, and distributed is much more cost-effective than large complex environments.</p>
<h3 id="myth-2-big-data-centers-can-be-sustainable">Myth 2: Big data centers can be sustainable</h3>
<p>The carbon footprint of a big data center is enormous. To improve the power usage effectiveness (PUE) of most data center farmers have adopted wind, hydro, and/or solar power technologies, which indeed helps drop their PUE by an estimated 20%. But is this leading to more sustainability?
<br/>
<br/>
This 20% looks great on paper and in the farmers’ corporate social responsibility reports. However, it just represents an improvement in the cooling technology and sourcing of energy. It doesn’t actually impact the energy consumed by the equipment that runs in their data centers (servers, storage chassis, physical disks, etc.) which is the equipment responsible for the carbon footprint. PUE only refers to overhead power consumption, i.e. cooling the facility, opening, and closing doors, maintaining power security systems, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Real improvement lies in deploying technologies that actually consume less power to deliver the actual Internet capacity to run workloads, real CPU chassis, physical disks, and storage cabinets. Improving on how hardware is being more effectively used can have an impact of up to a thousand percent and lead to ten times more power-efficiency.</p>
<h3 id="myth-3-redundant-systems-have-better-uptime">Myth 3: Redundant systems have better uptime</h3>
<p>A lot of us believe that systems need redundancy mechanisms to improve their operational uptime and reliability. While it may make sense to IT experts, let’s translate this for the non-IT world?
<br/>
<br/>
To make a car more reliable we add redundancy (as we do in IT). So for the risk of having a puncture, we add one extra tire for all the tires we use continuously. This adds 4 extra tires to the car. Then a decision needs to be made: Do we put those tires in a structure where they are always running along with the primary tires or do we choose not to have them “online” all the time, wearing and tearing in the same way as the primary tires?
<br/>
<br/>
Building such a system would take a large number of engineers to come up with a solution, and would change cars as we know them. Wouldn’t it make more sense to think outside the box and solve the root of the problem by making tires un-deflatable?
<br/>
<br/>
The IT industry has gone overboard with the concept of redundancy, having forgotten to look at the root cause issues. This has spawned a whole new industry of itself, which has a financial interest in creating complicated and expensive redundant systems.</p>
<h3 id="myth-4-big-companies-optimize-better">Myth 4: Big companies optimize better</h3>
<p>Big companies with a certain track record will know better how to optimize as they have more people and resources.
<br/>
<br/>
At first glance, this sounds logical, but in reality, ninety percent of the innovation within the IT space comes from startups. The giant IT companies have a heritage they hardly can overcome. They are locked in old infrastructure designs, and building outside of that infrastructure would be costly, timely, and probably put the breaks on their businesses.
<br/>
<br/>
Real innovation gives way to fix the core symptoms rather than taking the problem pain-killer approach.</p>
