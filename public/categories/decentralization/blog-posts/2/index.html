<p><em>This post is the third one in a series about building on ThreeFold’s open infrastructure. While <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.threefold.io/blog/build-on-threefolds-open-infrastructure/">part one</a>, gives you a comprehensive overview of the Grid, its evolution and capabilities, the <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.threefold.io/blog/build-on-threefolds-open-infrastructure-part-two/">second part</a> is focused on the low-level building blocks and particularly interesting for the more tech-savvy crowd.</em></p>
<br/>
<p>Welcome to the third and final part of our series on ThreeFold’s game-changing Internet infrastructure and the solutions available today. This time, we’ll show you what’s possible on the ThreeFold Playground today and how you can become one of the first testers of digitally sovereign end-user experiences.</p>
<br/>
<p>This is an incredible opportunity to become early adopters of our unique solutions, to get a taste of what it means to become digitally sovereign, and to help shape the future of the Internet. Together we build a decentralized digital world!</p>
<h2 id="explore-a-playground-full-of-simple-yet-powerful-deployment-experiences">Explore a playground full of simple yet powerful deployment experiences</h2>
<p>The <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://play.grid.tf/">ThreeFold Playground</a> makes it quite easy to build on top of the ThreeFold Grid by deploying weblets. A <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://library.threefold.me/info/manual/#/manual__weblets_home?id=weblets">weblet</a> is a compiled JavaScript component which can be embedded in any site. With ThreeFold, it basically establishes a private environment running inside your browser, and allows you to share it – while you maintain full control of all activities happening there by using your private key, and with full decentralization.</p>
<br/>
<p>On the TF Playground, a variety of applications are made available and deployable within just a few clicks, all on top of a fully decentralized peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure. From Virtual Machines to Kubernetes to Presearch Nodes, CapRover, ownCloud, and more – the playground allows you to build in a truly decentralized environment. Essentially, the Playground is an ever-expanding ecosystem of easily-deployable weblets that are built for a decentralized future. It’s the fastest way to build, test, and deploy and enables pretty much anyone to build and experiment with deployment on the Grid. So, this is huge!</p>
<br/>
<p><a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://play.grid.tf/">Visit</a> the TF Playground to explore the possibilities and read this <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-product-focus-series-tf-playground-v3-7-0/3315?u=hannahcordes">post</a> to find out what the new version 3.7.0 of the Playground – now live on testnet – has to offer. Dive right in and <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://library.threefold.me/info/manual/#/getstarted/manual__tfgrid3_getstarted">get started</a> on the TF Grid today!</p>
<br/>
<p>Here are a few examples of the weblets available on the Playground:</p>
<h4 id="presearch">Presearch</h4>
<p>Presearch is a longstanding partner of ThreeFold and one of the most popular solutions offered on the Grid. As of the Grid v3.6 release, any 3Node can now host a Presearch node – so if you’re a ThreeFold farmer, it’s now become quite easy for you to host Presearch on your own node. Simply follow <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/presearch-nodes/3250?u=hannahcordes">this deployment guide</a> to get decentralized search on top of a truly decentralized infrastructure!</p>
<h4 id="caprover">CapRover</h4>
<p>Leverage the entire <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/caprover-your-app-environment/2133/3">CapRover app catalogue</a> even faster and easier and deploy CapRover apps on the ThreeFold Grid. You’ll benefit from full decentralization, energy efficiency and affordability. <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/create-your-own-app-environment-fast-and-easy-with-caprover-on-the-people-s-internet/2644?u=hannahcordes">CapRover</a> is a powerful platform for app deployment and thanks to our <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://library.threefold.me/info/manual/#/manual__weblets_caprover?id=caprover">CapRover weblet</a>, you’re able to deploy anything you want on top of the ThreeFold Grid!</p>
<h4 id="new-subsquid-testnet">NEW: Subsquid (testnet)</h4>
<p>The <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/tfgrid-v3-7-0-is-now-live/3375?u=hannahcordes">latest addition</a> to the ThreeFold Playground is <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://library.threefold.me/info/manual/#/manual__weblets_subsquid">Subsquid</a>, Web3’s premier API framework which is supercharging decentralized apps across more than 30 chains. Basically, you can think of Subsquid as an ETL (extract, transform, load) tool, with a GraphQL server included. With Grid v3.7.0 live on testnet, you can now pre-process and decode raw chain data and store it for easier access by the query nodes by deploying your own Subsquid instance on the Grid’s testnet within just a few clicks <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://play.test.grid.tf/#/subsquid">here</a>.</p>
<br/>
<p>So with the ThreeFold Playground, ThreeFold is building a vast ecosystem of advanced deployment experiences and opening up a world of possibilities – allowing anyone to build, test and deploy easily and within a few clicks.</p>
<br/>
<p>And the best thing about the <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://library.threefold.me/info/manual/#/getstarted/manual__tfgrid3_getstarted">playground</a>? It’s already been available for a while and continuously being improved and extended!</p>

<br/>
<p>We’ve entered the <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.threefold.io/blog/four-phases-of-threefold/">third phase of our journey</a> towards our ultimate vision of a better future – the phase of Web 4. In addition to fully comprehensive decentralized edge cloud solutions, the ThreeFold ecosystem is also developing a range of applications and experiences across IoT, metaverse, blockchain, DeFi, banking, education and beyond.</p>
<br/>
<p>Throughout this phase – which has only just begun – a multitude of valuable and meaningful experiences are being built by the ThreeFold ecosystem and partners to empower people with equal chances to learn, create, and thrive in a decentralized digital economy – what we like to call an abundance-based future for humanity.</p>

<p>The first roll-out of the third phase will empower people to become fully self-sovereign thanks to ThreeFold’s Digital Twin technology and a variety of decentralized alternatives to popular applications and tools. </p>
<h4 id="freeflow-twin">FreeFlow Twin</h4>
<p>The Digital Twin technology provides each user with a unique digital identity that can serve as the key to an open, self-sovereign and complete digital future. This solution was designed with a very simple objective in mind: everyone should be the center of their entire digital life. It represents your digital self and hosts your entire digital life in a secure and private way – empowering you to own your data and offering you decentralized applications that enable you to maintain your sovereignty. For end users, owning their own deployments opens the possibility for a full range of experiences that have the same quality as crypto – self custody.</p>
<br/>
<p>With Grid V3.7.0, ThreeFold’s all-in-one decentralized productivity tool that includes instant messaging, video call, social, and data storage features – formerly known as Uhuru – is being rebranded to <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/lets-test-out-freeflow-twin-beta-formerly-uhuru/3299?u=hannahcordes">FreeFlow Twin</a>. It brings sovereign and secure alternatives to many of the centralized solutions we use every day like Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, Chrome, Zoom and many more.</p>
<br/>
<p><a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-product-updates-august-2022/3272?u=hannahcordes">FreeFlow Twin</a> will be part of an ecosystem of decentralized alternatives called FreeFlow Life. Find more information on the experiences, how to start testing now and where to share your feedback <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/lets-test-out-freeflow-twin-beta-formerly-uhuru/3299?u=hannahcordes">here</a>!</p>
<br/>
<p>This paradigm shift is a pretty big deal, isn’t it?</p>
<h4 id="defi-solutions">DeFi Solutions</h4>
<p>We’ve also decided to develop our <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.threefold.io/blog/future-tft-ecosystem/">own DeFi solutions</a> to support the growth and expansion of the Internet of Internets and an abundance-based future where we are truly sovereign: community-based liquidity pools and the P2P DeFi Wallet – both expected early next year. Learn more about the upcoming solutions <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.threefold.io/blog/future-tft-ecosystem/">here</a>!</p>
<h2 id="the-grid-is-open-an-invitation-to-build-deploy-and-test">The Grid is open – an invitation to build, deploy and test</h2>
<p>ThreeFold’s open Internet infrastructure is fully peer-to-peer, decentralized and super reliable. It already offers a multitude of solutions for developers, end-users and everyone in-between. And the Grid and the solutions offered are ready for the community to build, deploy and test, as we continue to collectively build, advance and expand.</p>
<br/>
<p>And while we’ve collectively already built a lot and achieved crucial milestones towards realizing our ultimate goals, we’re also just the beginning of the third phase of our exciting journey with many ambitions and goals still ahead.</p>
<br/>
<p>While we’re still in a spot where we can be considered a hidden gem and being way undervalued, remember this: ThreeFold is inevitable. We are visionaries, building the plane in the air. We are confident in growing the project in a real and authentic way. We have a strong plan and vision. Our technology is needed. The underlying foundation is functional and ready. Now, it’s up to the believers to build, test and deploy the solutions we need for a better world. And together, we build.

          This post is part of an ongoing series on building on ThreeFold’s open infrastructure. It’s for the more tech-savvy crowd, as we’ll dive into our cloud solution and everything enabled by the technology and tooling built on top.
        </p>
        
        <div class="article hidden"><p><em>“This article was originally published by Hannah Cordes, a former member of ThreeFold Foundation.”</em></p>
<br>
<p>ThreeFold’s reliable, open-source, peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure together with a growing community of enthusiastic, driven early-adopter developers and end-users are the key to accelerating the growth and development of the Grid and to unlocking all of its potential. While the foundation has been laid, it will be up to all of us as a movement to improve and build upon it.</p>
<br/>
<p>After looking back at the ThreeFold Grid’s evolution and what makes it a game-changing Internet infrastructure in <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.threefold.io/blog/build-on-threefolds-open-infrastructure/">part one</a>, it’s time to explore our cloud solution and the technology available today in part two! You can think of these as some of the essential low-level building blocks that when combined created a limitless sandbox for developers.</p>
<br/>
<p>If you’re wondering what virtual machines are, haven’t heard about Kubernetes before and don’t know your way around coding languages, this part might be less interesting for you. Feel free to skip and jump right into <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.threefold.io/blog/build-on-threefolds-open-infrastructure-part-three/">part three</a> on weblets and end-user experiences.</p>
<h2 id="elements-of-our-comprehensive-decentralized-cloud-solution">Elements of our comprehensive &amp; decentralized cloud solution</h2>
<p>The ThreeFold Grid provides <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/technology/threefold__tfgrid_primitives">various primitives</a> for compute, storage, and network – fulfilling all the needs centralized cloud providers cater to as well, while offering advantages in terms of decentralization, energy efficiency, security and more. <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/all-you-need-to-know-about-zero-os/1734">Zero-OS</a> includes a collection of components, called primitives. These primitives are the low-level constructs which can be deployed on the ThreeFold Grid. As mentioned above, they act as building blocks for skilled developers that enable them to build and create in complete digital freedom.</p>
<br/>
<p>Additionally, the high compatibility of ThreeFold’s primitives with industry-standard tools and protocols makes it easy and seamless for developers to migrate workloads to the Grid. All of the primitives not only benefit from the unique efficiency and security features of <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/technology/threefold__zos">Zero-OS</a>, but also come with unique features and capabilities themselves. Here are some of the primitives to give you an idea of what you’ll get:</p>
<h4 id="zmachine">ZMachine</h4>
<p>ThreeFold’s <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/technology/zmachine?id=zmachine">ZMachine</a> is a lightweight virtual machine (VM) solution that’s unique to the ThreeFold Grid. ZMachine enables both traditional VM deployments and also introduces a next generation container specification built on our <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/technology/threefold__zos_fs?id=why-this-zflist-concept">ZFlist</a> technology. ZFlist containers enabled by ZMachines are more secure and more flexible than the current industry standard Docker-based containers. With Kubernetes running on top of ThreeFold’s ZMachine <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/tfgrid/threefold__grid_use?id=tfgrid-kubernetes-cloud">technology</a>, we have a highly compatible and unique solution.</p>
<h4 id="zflist">ZFlist</h4>
<p>The <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/technology/threefold__zos_fs?id=why-this-zflist-concept">ZFlist</a> is a next generation container format – supported directly at the operating system level on Zero-OS – which extends the industry-standard Docker container concept in an efficient and secure way. It provides a unique advantage over traditional containers via the use of mini VMs. By employing mini VMs, the FList concept provides better isolation than traditional container systems while retaining the advantages that containers offer over full VMs.</p>
<h4 id="kubernetes">Kubernetes</h4>
<p>ThreeFold has long supported the most used open-source container orchestration tool in the world, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, which integrates the industry standard <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> format, a container creation and management tool. It’s used to manage many of the largest and most complex cloud deployments. Kubernetes can be used to create a production-ready environment. The ThreeFold Grid provides a lightweight Kubernetes VM that can be used to create clusters according to specific needs. By providing both VMs and Kubernetes, we’re able to offer the most comprehensive solution in the decentralized/blockchain space to deploy, scale, and manage cloud compute workloads. Kubernetes users can, for the most part, simply bring their existing configuration files and recreate their deployments on a Grid based cluster seamlessly. With the third generation of the Grid, we provided a very simple way to provision <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://library.threefold.me/info/manual/#/manual3_iac/grid3_terraform/manual__terraform_k8s?id=more-info">Kubernetes clusters with Terraform</a>.</p>
<h4 id="terraform">Terraform</h4>
<p><a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-grid-3-0-supports-terraform/1184?u=hannahcordes">Terraform</a> is a widely-used open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) software tool enabling a consistent workflow in order to manage complex deployments across different cloud providers. It also integrates directly with our Grid’s <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/cloud/threefold__usp_compatible?id=kubernetes">existing Kubernetes functionality</a> to offer a complete solution for reserving hardware and deploying software.</p>
<br/>
<p>In a nutshell, Terraform offers a complete solution for reserving hardware and deploying software. It allows for specifying deployments on the <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/tfgrid/threefold__tfgrid_home">ThreeFold Grid</a> in a simple, declarative, and human-readable language describing the desired end state. Terraform can be used to deploy the full set of <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/all-you-need-to-know-about-zero-os/1734">Zero-OS</a> primitives, supporting any existing or future Linux workload, with endless possibilities. It is like a lower-level Kubernetes for the hardware part of cloud deployments.</p>
<h4 id="dedicated-nodes">Dedicated Nodes</h4>
<p>We’re also supporting <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/exciting-news-dedicated-nodes-on-the-people-s-internet/2645?u=hannahcordes">dedicated nodes</a>. By utilizing dedicated nodes on the ThreeFold Grid, you’ll benefit from a truly decentralized and highly reliable Internet infrastructure that uses less energy and comes at a much more affordable price than any comparable alternative. With dedicated nodes, users are able to exclusively reserve the entire capacity of a 3Node to deploy solutions for themselves or for other customers, while also paying for all capacity of the respective 3Node. Dedicated nodes on our Grid will be highly cost effective, as they’ll be available with a 70% discount on <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/pricing-for-tfgrid/2518/7">pricing</a>. All the ThreeFold Grid features will be available on <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/exciting-news-dedicated-nodes-on-the-people-s-internet/2645?u=hannahcordes">dedicated nodes</a> as well – from deploying VMs and containers to CapRover and more. Dedicated and non-dedicated 3Nodes can be combined.</p>
<h4 id="v-language">V Language</h4>
<p>ThreeFold is built with simplicity in mind which is why we’re using <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.threefold.io/partners/vlang/">V</a> – a statically typed programming language similar to Go, and inspired by Rust, Swift, and Oberon. It’s the official <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/technology/threefold__smartcontract_it">smart contract</a> language on the Grid, as its simplicity and readability allows anyone to go through and understand any code base, even non-developers.</p>
<br/>
<p>Despite being simple, V gives a lot of power to the developer and can be used in pretty much every field, including systems programming, webdev, gamedev, GUI, mobile, science, embedded, tooling, etc. It aims to become an alternative to JavaScript as the de facto coding language on the market in the upcoming years. With V, the developer doesn’t need to change anything in their code. “It just works”, like in Python, Go, or Java, except there’s no heavy GC tracing everything or expensive RC for each object. V can translate your entire C project and offer you the safety, simplicity, and 10-25x faster compilation speeds.</p>
<br/>
<p>With +30,5K Stars on <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://github.com/vlang/v">GitHub</a>, V brings a strong open-source developer community to the ThreeFold ecosystem to develop the infrastructures and applications of tomorrow – making it the ideal smart contract language for the ThreeFold ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="an-open-invitation">An open invitation</h2>
<p>So, now that you’ve learned more about the building blocks of the ThreeFold Grid and how you can build with them, we’d like to invite you to try and test them yourselves!</p>
<br/>
<p>While we’re very proud of our progress and the strong ecosystem around us, now’s the time to build upon the foundation. The team continues to do incredible work to further develop and advance the Grid with each and every release. They continue to improve the components, develop new features and build new solutions.</p>

          Dive into the magic of the ThreeFold Grid and what it enables for people around the world – from developers to end users, and everyone in between – with this three-part series! We’ll explore ThreeFold’s infrastructure, solutions and experiences available today. The first part will give a comprehensive overview of the Grid, its evolution and capabilities.
        </p>
        
        <div class="article hidden"><p><em>“This article was originally published by Hannah Cordes, a former member of ThreeFold Foundation.”</em></p>
<br>
<p>What started out as an idea for a better Internet about a decade ago amongst a few early Internet and Cloud pioneers has now become a reality. Today, ThreeFold is a global movement building a reliable, open and inclusive Internet.</p>
<br/>
<p>We’ve reached a pivotal moment in the evolution of the Internet. And ThreeFold is ready to unlock a new Internet era – one filled with <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.threefold.io/blog/planet-first-people-first/">abundance and opportunity</a> for all, one which is better for <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.threefold.io/blog/planting-the-seeds/">our planet</a>. Our open-source technology, future-facing ecosystem and collaborative community have the potential to drive this new era forward.</p>
<br/>
<p>For us, the Internet was always meant to be <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.threefold.io/blog/p2p-web3/">peer-to-peer</a>, where anyone could own hardware, and connect and exchange directly with full security and in full privacy – without any entity in the middle. This is how the Internet began. But as demand grew, big tech began to monopolize its infrastructure and all the major platforms.</p>
<br/>
<p>Since its inception, ThreeFold has been committed not only to delivering on the original promise of the Internet, but also to realizing our ultimate vision of a better future for all. For the past six years, we’ve been building up an incredible full-stack, open-source, decentralized Internet, all <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/how-threefold-is-building-a-new-internet-from-the-ground-up/2057?u=hannahcordes">from the ground-up</a>. We’ve come a long way and the result is, well, exceptional. There is <em>nothing</em> else out there like ThreeFold.</p>
<br/>
<p>From creating our own blockchain-driven and highly secure <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/all-you-need-to-know-about-zero-os/1734?u=hannahcordes">operating system</a> (which allows computers to become decentralized servers), to building an ultra-scalable <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/technology/qsss/threefold__qsss_home?id=quantum-safe-storage-system">Quantum Safe Storage System</a>, a complete far <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.threefold.io/blog/internet-at-the-edge/">edge cloud</a> computing platform and a <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/how-our-planetary-network-works/1210?u=hannahcordes">planetary peer-to-peer network</a> all accessible via a unique Smart Contract for IT on the <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.threefold.io/blog/tf-chain/">ThreeFold Blockchain</a>, we’re proud to have the most <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.threefold.io/blog/internet-at-the-edge/">complete edge infrastructure</a> to power the next-generation Internet era.</p>
<br/>
<p>And we’re taking concrete steps to further expand this infrastructure that offers a truly decentralized layer 0 for any blockchain or Internet application. Moreover, with the help of our <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://t.me/threefoldtesting">community of Grid testers</a>, we’re continuously advancing the underlying technology and working towards making it usable for as many people and use cases as possible.</p>
<br/>
<p>Our vision and technology have matured into the <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.threefold.io/blog/internet-of-internets/">Internet of Internets</a> – a network of thousands of community-built and -owned Internets through which we strive to interconnect all of humanity. A new world is coming, and <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/technology/threefold__technology">our technology</a> has the potential to revolutionize digitization on a global scale, across sectors. And yet we remain a hidden gem.</p>
<br/>
<p>So, what solutions does the ThreeFold Grid offer today already? And why exactly should you start to build on top of ThreeFold? Let’s explore some of the many possibilities available today.</p>
<h2 id="the-threefold-grid-a-cutting-edge-highly-scalable-peer-to-peer-infrastructure">The ThreeFold Grid – A cutting-edge, highly scalable peer-to-peer infrastructure</h2>
<p><em>“ThreeFold is growing the ThreeFold Grid by enabling a community of thousands of farmers from around the world to participate and own a piece of the Internet.” – <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://threefold.io/news/post/threefold_cybernews/">Adnan Fatayerji</a></em></p>
<br/>
<p>The Grid is a peer-to-peer cloud computing network that’s highly compatible with current industry standards. In late December 2021, ThreeFold launched the third generation of the ThreeFold Grid on mainnet with a fully functional tech stack – a huge and crucial step towards a fully production-ready and decentralized infrastructure. The third generation not only brought a massive leap forward in the decentralization of the Grid but also made for a much simpler user experience for farmers and Grid users. People from all over the world are connecting thousands of 3Nodes to create the world’s largest decentralized Internet infrastructure, and new capacity is being connected every day. Find the latest Grid stats and utilization numbers in <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/grid-stats-new-nodes-overview/3291?u=hannahcordes">this regularly updated thread</a>.</p>
<br/>
<p><a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.threefold.io/blog/threefold-2022-reflect-h1-outlook-h2/">Over the past months</a>, the team evolved the Grid through version 3.6.1 and upgraded it to mainnet in July after receiving 100% community approval. This <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/tfgrid-product-updates-july-2022-tfgrid-v3-6-1-highlights-and-more/3206/2?u=hannahcordes">release</a> introduces more stability to the TF Grid and includes various upgrades and new features like the ThreeFold Connect App, the new unified dashboard for a simpler user experience, and more. Big progress was also made in terms of the DAO functionality that went live on TF Chain, with the first TF Chain (L1) DAO proposal was voted on and approved in August.</p>
<br/>
<p>And with each new Grid release, we’re getting one step closer to solidifying the foundation of the Internet of Internets. Currently, the team is working towards completing <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-product-updates-august-2022/3272?u=hannahcordes">Grid version 3.7.0</a> which includes some significant updates, improvements and new features like FreeFlow Twin, a new Node Pilot, new deployment features and <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-product-updates-august-2022/3272?u=hannahcordes">a lot more</a>. The team continues to do incredible work to further develop and advance the Grid as well as to support utilization and adoption by offering tools and applications that are user-friendly, secure, efficient and scalable. A massive thank you to our incredible tech team and the community of Grid testers!</p>
<h3 id="next-up-our-cloud-solution">Next up: our cloud solution</h3>
<p>So, the ThreeFold Grid has been evolved, advanced and expanded quite a bit, hasn’t it? About time to take a closer look at our cloud solution and everything enabled by the technology and tooling built on top. As a heads up, part two of our series on ThreeFold’s game-changing Internet infrastructure is for the more tech-savvy crowd. If you don’t consider yourself “a tech person” you might prefer to jump to part three on weblets and end-user experiences right away.</p>

          With emerging technologies like IoT, Web 3 and more, computing needs to be pushed from centralized data centers to the edge of the network. Learn why ThreeFold is the ideal foundation for a thriving interconnected future.
        </p>
        
        <div class="article hidden"><p>With new devices being connected every day and emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), the metaverse and Web 3 gaining popularity, the <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.cbre.com/en/insights/reports/north-america-data-center-trends-h2-2021">demand</a> for Internet capacity is booming. Already, these developments are shifting the <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.securityinfowatch.com/perimeter-security/physical-hardening/article/21263002/real-words-or-buzzwords-edge-cloud-and-the-evolving-internet">Internet’s “center of gravity”</a> from its core to the edges in order to keep up with the growing demand. In an increasingly interconnected world, centralized cloud architectures are proving to be <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/03/25/demystifying-edge-technology/">bottlenecks</a> hindering future growth.</p>
<br/>
<p>Here are some interesting numbers to emphasize the explosive growth of connected devices and the impending data explosion:</p>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>Back in 2018, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.securityinfowatch.com/perimeter-security/physical-hardening/article/21263002/real-words-or-buzzwords-edge-cloud-and-the-evolving-internet">90% of global data creation</a> took place within the two previous years.</li>
<li>In 2022, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.securityinfowatch.com/perimeter-security/physical-hardening/article/21263002/real-words-or-buzzwords-edge-cloud-and-the-evolving-internet">4.95 billion people</a> are using the Internet and about <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.securityinfowatch.com/perimeter-security/physical-hardening/article/21263002/real-words-or-buzzwords-edge-cloud-and-the-evolving-internet">2.5 quintillion bytes</a> of data are created on a daily basis.</li>
<li>About 2 billion computers, 15 billion mobile devices and more than 22 billion IoT devices are <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.securityinfowatch.com/perimeter-security/physical-hardening/article/21263002/real-words-or-buzzwords-edge-cloud-and-the-evolving-internet">active worldwide</a> on a daily basis.</li>
<li>By 2025, more than <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/executive-perspectives/annual-internet-report/index.html">1 billion people</a> and <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/471264/iot-number-of-connected-devices-worldwide/#:~:text=Internet%20of%20Things%20%2D%20number%20of%20connected%20devices%20worldwide%202015%2D2025&amp;text=By%202025%2C%20forecasts%20suggest%20that,IoT%20installed%20base%20in%202019.">75 billion IoT devices</a> are expected to join the Internet.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>And yet, the expansion of Internet capacity still largely occurs in the same centralized and inefficient way. The client-server model of hyperscale data centers is unable to meet this rapidly growing demand due to high building and operational costs to fulfill bandwidth, performance and cybersecurity requirements. As data centers are primarily built in the US, China and Europe, emerging countries have to be connected via sea cables which makes the model’s limitations particularly severe for these countries. And even in countries where many data centers are located, they are built in regions where land and electricity are as cheap as possible. Consequently, the bulk of data centers is still <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.securityinfowatch.com/perimeter-security/physical-hardening/article/21263002/real-words-or-buzzwords-edge-cloud-and-the-evolving-internet">far away</a> from where the majority of users and connected devices reside, and where huge amounts of data are generated that require processing – resulting in a <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/tfgrid/threefold__grid_valuation?id=what39s-the-potential-of-the-threefold-grid">weak distribution</a> of Internet capacity.</p>
<br/>
<p>About <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.seagate.com/files/www-content/our-story/rethink-data/files/Rethink_Data_Report_2020.pdf">175 Zettabytes</a> of data will be created by 2025, as our economy becomes increasingly digital and data driven. And this amount of data needs to be captured, stored and activated in a secure, efficient and high-performing way. So, the aforementioned technological use cases will not only <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.cbre.com/en/insights/reports/north-america-data-center-trends-h2-2021">accelerate the demand</a> for Internet capacity but also require edge capabilities, such as low latencies, in order to run and scale successfully. In fact, the centralized data center model poses one of the biggest obstacles to the success and spread of the Internet of Things and related applications. This will have to change. Actually, industry experts <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.i-scoop.eu/edge-computing-explained/">expect 75%</a> of data to be processed outside of the traditional data center or cloud model by 2025.</p>
<h2 id="the-rise-of-edge-computing">The rise of edge computing</h2>
<p>Computing needs to be pushed from centralized data centers to the edge to support the massive data consumption coupled to the rise of connected devices and emerging technologies. For instance, as more and more home appliances and devices are getting interconnected through the IoT economy, the amount of real-time data generated within our homes on a daily basis is rapidly expanding. Edge computing <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.i-scoop.eu/edge-computing-explained/">tackles the shortcomings</a> of the centralized model in terms of bandwidth, latency and autonomy. It enables applications and solutions to be hosted closer to where their data is being produced and consumed, thereby allowing for low latencies, rapid data processing and real-time decisions. </p>
<br/>
<p>The industry analyst company <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS48772522">IDC estimates</a> the global spending on edge computing to increase by 14.8% compared to 2021 – amounting to roughly $176 billion in 2022. By 2025, this number is predicted to reach about $274 billion.</p>
<br/>
<p>The idea of edge computing’s ability to process data on-site is simple enough. Nevertheless, edge computing fails to deliver on its promise as it still remains somewhat centralized today. Granted, so-called edge data centers are <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://stlpartners.com/articles/edge-computing/edge-data-centres/">closer</a> to where the data is being consumed than hyperscale data centers. But while they do provide an improvement from traditional data centers, they are not able to provide <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.thefastmode.com/expert-opinion/23002-what-are-various-types-of-edge-computing-that-exist-today">far-edge</a> capabilities, i.e. moving as close to the user and point of data creation as possible. They are simply smaller types of data centers that are still operated in a centralized manner, require the <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://connectorsupplier.com/how-the-rise-of-edge-computing-will-reshape-the-data-center-landscape/">same infrastructure elements</a> as centralized data centers, and usually <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/definition/edge-data-center">rely</a> on bigger, central data centers. Quite edgy isn’t it?</p>
<br/>
<p>As the need for Internet capacity – specifically at the edge – is rapidly intensifying, a new approach to Internet infrastructure is clearly needed. The Web 3 movement created a spur of interest across industries due to its promise to decentralize the Internet and cloud as we know it. Future data will be generated at the edge of the network and Internet which certainly requires an <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/03/25/demystifying-edge-technology/">architectural shift</a> away from the current model.</p>
<h2 id="realizing-an-interconnected-future">Realizing an interconnected future</h2>
<p>Ironically, decades after the spark of the open-source peer-to-peer Internet movement was steamrolled by large tech companies and governments eager to centralize the global Internet, we seem to enter an era of decentralization again. There’s no doubt that large tech companies did bring a lot of innovation to our global Internet and cloud stack. Technically though, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://threefold.io/blog/p2p_web3/">peer-to-peer</a> systems have always been the most scalable option. Moreover, open-source architectures have built a strong reputation for providing high levels of security and flexibility. </p>
<br/>
<p>In a peer-to-peer model, people and devices are able to exchange directly, without intermediaries or servers in the middle – leading to a more energy-efficient, scalable and flexible paradigm that can expand on-demand. And undoubtedly, open-source will play a <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/edge-computing-said-quissal-zededa/">key role</a> in edge computing by simplifying and enhancing the building and deployment of software at the edge.</p>
<br/>
<p>By leveraging open-source and peer-to-peer technologies, ThreeFold has come up with an Internet infrastructure that is capable of far-edge computing. ThreeFold offers a powerful set of <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://threefold.io/blog/building_a_new_internet_from_the_ground_up_3/">compute primitives</a> that provide the agility to create and deploy containers, Virtual Machines (VMs) and <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/technology/threefold__zkube?id=zkube">Kubernetes</a> environments at the edge. Having integrated all leading industry-standard tools, ThreeFold’s solution allows for a seamless migration of any digital workload, making ThreeFold the ideal infrastructure for edge workloads. And all data produced by these workloads can be stored in a way that is ultra safe, highly reliable and <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/technology/qsss/threefold__qsss_home?id=quantum-safe-storage-system">unbreakable</a>. Combined with end-to-end encrypted peer-to-peer <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/technology/threefold__planetary_network?id=planetary-network">networking</a>, applications can be hosted closer to where the data is being consumed – representing the ideal underlying layer for IoT networks, blockchain-based workloads and more to run and scale at the edge seamlessly, efficiently and privately.</p>
<br/>
<p>The shift towards the edge is inevitable. ThreeFold is the first full-stack, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://coincheckup.com/blog/threefold-is-the-decentralized-web-the-future-of-the-internet/">decentralized</a>, peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure in the world that combines compute in the form of highly-optimized containers, storage and network capacity in an all-in-one solution. With  more than <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://threefold.io/">81 Petabytes</a> of capacity distributed across thousands of 3Nodes and 76 countries as well as <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://threefold.io/blog/connecting_the_dots/">plans</a> to sponsor the expansion of the Internet to developing regions, ThreeFold is the foundation for a thriving interconnected future that is secure, borderless and at the edge.</p>

          Oftentimes, the Internet’s significant energy consumption and climate impacts go unnoticed. At ThreeFold, we&#x27;re leading the way by working on energy-efficient and sustainable solutions for the Internet.
        </p>
        
        <div class="article hidden"><p><em>“This article was originally published by Hannah Cordes, a former member of ThreeFold Foundation.”</em></p>
<br>
<p><em>Global carbon emissions keep rising. Climate change and the collapse of biodiversity are accelerating faster than ever before. And yet, it’s important to believe in our ability to change our behaviour if we are to secure our children’s future. It’s not about being naive or optimistic, but rather a commitment to change and to do better. Across the globe, movements are sprouting to save our planet. How does ThreeFold take part in this? How are we contributing to making the world a better place?</em>  </p>
<br/>
<p>Once emitted, carbon can remain in our atmosphere for hundreds of years. To survive climate change, massive amounts of carbon emissions have to be offset – and fast. According to a UN report, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/08/1027908/carbon-removal-hype-is-a-dangerous-distraction-climate-change/">10 billion tons</a> of carbon emissions will have to be removed on a yearly basis by 2050 to prevent the planet from moving past the 2 degree Celsius threshold. Allowing the climate to heat by just one more degree would have unprecedented consequences – including the sinking of islands and coastal areas, an accelerated rate of extinction (right now, estimations suggest that about <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/global_extinction_rates_why_do_estimates_vary_so_wildly">24 to 150 species go extinct</a> every day) and much more. Our complacency towards climate change proves that we’re still in denial of the chain reaction and butterfly effects of our past and present actions.</p>
<br/>
<p>Clearly, we’ve already crossed the threshold in the climate crisis where we had enough time for long debates on potential measures and policies. The time for those debates was in the 1960s, when a <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.climatefiles.com/climate-change-evidence/presidents-report-atmospher-carbon-dioxide/">report</a> by former US President Johnson’s Science Advisory Committee first warned about the risks and dangers of excessive carbon emissions. “Climate change is the result of more than a century of unsustainable energy and land use, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production,” said Jim Skea, one of the IPCC Working Group III Co-Chairs in a <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.enviro.or.id/2022/04/ipcc-press-release/">press release</a> published earlier this month. According to <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-3/">a report</a> published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we can still achieve our climate goals if we significantly reduce emissions across all economic sectors. However, we urgently need to take action to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>Now is the time to act. Now is the time for bold moves. As Skea put it: “Without immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors, it will be impossible.”</p>
<h2 id="the-astonishing-carbon-footprint-of-the-internet">The astonishing carbon footprint of the Internet</h2>
<p>While people are legitimately obsessing about the emissions caused by air travel and whether to take that plane or not – bestowing us with concepts like ‘flight shaming’ – other industries’ significant impacts almost go unnoticed. One of them is the Internet.</p>
<br/>
<p>Think about the <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://carbonliteracy.com/the-carbon-cost-of-an-email/">chat messages and emails</a> you send out every day. How many times do you <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90171268/internet_impact_visualized">‘google’</a> things? How much time do you spend <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.carbontrust.com/resources/carbon-impact-of-video-streaming">streaming</a> music or videos? All of your online activities add to your carbon footprint. There are a couple grams of carbon emissions attached to the energy needed to power your devices and the wireless networks you connect to. On top of that comes the significant amount of energy required to support the infrastructure of today’s Internet, namely millions of data centers and the thousands of servers in each of them.</p>
<br/>
<p>Even though the emissions caused by streaming one song or sending one email may seem insignificant, the accumulated use of the Internet by billions of people all over the world adds up. It actually leads to a collective carbon footprint amounting to a share of roughly <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200305-why-your-internet-habits-are-not-as-clean-as-you-think">3.7% of global emissions</a> caused by the Internet and its infrastructure – and these carbon emissions are estimated<a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200305-why-your-internet-habits-are-not-as-clean-as-you-think"> to double</a> within the next three years. This 3.7% share of global emissions by the Internet almost makes the global aviation industry with its estimated <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.atag.org/facts-figures.html">2.1%</a> emissions look good.</p>
<br/>
<p>The global pandemic – while decreasing emissions in aviation due to travel bans – has already accelerated Internet consumption and the resulting footprint due to increased streaming behaviour, remote work and more. With <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/executive-perspectives/annual-internet-report/index.html">1 billion people</a> and <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/471264/iot-number-of-connected-devices-worldwide/#:~:text=Internet%20of%20Things%20%2D%20number%20of%20connected%20devices%20worldwide%202015%2D2025&amp;text=By%202025%2C%20forecasts%20suggest%20that,IoT%20installed%20base%20in%202019.">75 billion IoT devices</a> expected to join the Internet economy by 2025, a more sustainable infrastructure than power-hungry data centers is urgently needed to meet the future growth of the Internet in an ethical and sustainable way.</p>
<h2 id="data-centers-are-power-hungry">Data Centers are power hungry</h2>
<p>Big tech corporations like Amazon, for example, have massive carbon footprints with their corporate facilities, power-hungry data centers, complex operations and more. One larger data center alone consumes up to <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/opinions/from-the-sensor-to-the-data-center/">120 MW</a> – and there are about 7.2 million data centers worldwide, according to <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/500458/worldwide-datacenter-and-it-sites/">Statista</a>. Moreover, a data center’s energy consumption accounts for <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/opinions/from-the-sensor-to-the-data-center/">about 40%</a> of its operating costs. In 2020, Amazon emitted more than <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/environment/sustainable-operations/carbon-footprint">60 million metric tons</a> of carbon dioxide up from about 51 million in 2019. Others like Google try to downplay their energy consumption by switching to renewable energy. While renewable energy is an improvement for sure, it does not change the fact that Google’s energy consumption could <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertbryce/2020/10/21/googles-dominance-is-fueled-by-zambia-size-amounts-of-electricity/">power entire countries</a>.</p>
<br/>
<p>Is that really a desirable way for us to use the still scarce supply of renewable energy? Shouldn’t we rather focus on the root problem and on becoming more energy efficient in the first place?</p>
<br/>
<p>The first step should be to reduce the Internet’s energy consumption and overall carbon footprint. But even then: reducing that energy consumption and transitioning to clean energy will only get us so far – particularly when considering that there simply is not enough clean energy to achieve a complete transition. Those emissions that cannot be cut have to be compensated for. A holistic solution to today’s Internet’s inefficiencies and emissions is needed.</p>
<h2 id="an-energy-efficient-and-regenerative-internet">An energy-efficient and regenerative Internet</h2>
<p>In December 2021, ThreeFold <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/threefold-and-take-action-global-partner-to-bring-internet-access-to-1-billion-people-across-the-globe-301446693.html">announced</a> its commitment to achieve a carbon double win for its open-source peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure, the ThreeFold Grid. The ThreeFold Grid is able to scale anywhere electricity and network exist, using about 10 times less energy than any comparable alternative while being more affordable as well. By starting from scratch at the operating system level, ThreeFold was able to build an Internet infrastructure that is highly <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://threefold.io/blog/for_our_planet/">energy efficient</a>. This infrastructure is already made up of thousands of 3Nodes that are spread across 75 countries and counting.</p>
<br/>
<p>Together with <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/driving-regeneration-with-tag/2120?u=hannahcordes">Take Action Global</a> (TAG), an expert on climate education and action, ThreeFold aims to make the ThreeFold Grid planet-positive by removing its carbon emissions from the atmosphere three times in the form of <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-on-track-to-be-planet-positive/2097?u=hannahcordes">Voluntary Carbon Credits</a>. While the pilot for this initiative was announced to start in January 2022, ThreeFold and TAG were so eager to take action against climate change, they kicked-off the pilot one month early in December 2021. It is the first step in ThreeFold’s plan to support the use of ‘nature-based climate solutions’ like tree planting to absorb twice more carbon than the ThreeFold Grid emits by 2022. </p>
<h2 id="a-silver-lining-on-the-horizon">A silver lining on the horizon</h2>
<p>Every industry and organization has to pull their own weight. There is no way around it. Far-reaching actions and transformations are needed across industries to limit global warming to bearable levels. “The decisions we make now can secure a liveable future. We have the tools and know-how required to limit warming,” said Hoesung Lee, IPCC Chair, in an April 2022 <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.enviro.or.id/2022/04/ipcc-press-release/">press release</a>. Together with TAG, ThreeFold leads the way by working on energy-efficient and sustainable solutions for the Internet. The new IPCC report gives us a reason to be optimistic about our future and have hope for the regeneration of our planet.</p>
<br/>
<p>Really, all it takes right now is widespread support and adoption of more energy-efficient, sustainable alternatives across industries like ThreeFold for the Internet – something that is up to each and every one of us. Let us all take action for a fairer, more sustainable world.</p>

        <div class="article hidden"><p><em>“This article was originally published by Hannah Cordes, a former member of ThreeFold Foundation.”</em></p>
<br>
<p>In <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/the-history-of-bitcoin-when-did-bitcoin-start">October 2008</a>, when the financial crisis was in full swing, an anonymous individual or group under the pseudonym ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ published a <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">white paper</a> on Bitcoin, a “peer-to-peer electronic cash system” that ended up disrupting the financial system and sparked the creation of an entirely new industry: crypto mining.</p>
<br/>
<p>Considering that many people view Bitcoin as a commodity, similar to gold, it only makes sense that the process of generating new Bitcoins would become referred to as ‘mining’. In a way, mining is an incentive mechanism to reach consensus in the verification of transactions in a decentralized network. While crypto mining originated from Bitcoin, the system has spread quite widely across the blockchain space.</p>
<br/>
<p>More than a decade later, Bitcoin keeps intriguing individuals and organizations all around the world, and has become <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/is-bitcoin-a-waste-of-energy-pros-and-cons-about-bitcoin-mining">one of the most popular</a> financial assets. Nevertheless, criticism and doubts around Bitcoin and crypto mining remain. The most popular cryptocurrency is also frequently brought to the spotlight around its potential affiliations to money laundering, financing of terrorism and cybercrime, as well as the energy the mining process of its cryptocurrency consumes. </p>
<br/>
<p>According to the <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://cbeci.org/">Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index</a> of the University of Cambridge, the annual consumption of Bitcoin is currently estimated to amount to nearly 140 TWh. The United Arab Emirates (113 TWh) or the Netherlands (109 TWh) had a lower annual energy consumption than Bitcoin <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="http://blog.zorinaq.com/bitcoin-electricity-consumption/">in 2020</a>. Moreover, news outlets like <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/27/bitcoin-mining-consumes-electricity-ireland">The Guardian</a> or <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952">BBC News</a> reported on Bitcoin exceeding the energy consumption of further countries, including Ireland and Argentina. Within the last year, headlines like “<a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/09/03/climate/bitcoin-carbon-footprint-electricity.html">Bitcoin Uses More Electricity Than Many Countries</a>” in the New York Times or “<a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.ft.com/content/1aecb2db-8f61-427c-a413-3b929291c8ac">Bitcoin’s growing energy problem: ‘It’s a dirty currency’</a>” in the Financial Times were in no short supply.</p>
<br/>
<p>Among the most popular quotes on the topic is Bill Gates’ statement in the New York Times in <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/09/business/dealbook/bill-gates-bitcoin.html">March 2021</a>: “Bitcoin uses more electricity per transaction than any other method known to mankind, and so it’s not a great climate thing.” Not that this statement or the awareness of the issue would have prevented Microsoft from launching <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">ION</a>, a decentralized digital identity system, to run on the Bitcoin network.</p>
<h2 id="but-why-is-bitcoin-mining-so-energy-intensive-anyways">But why is Bitcoin mining so energy intensive anyways?</h2>
<p>At the heart of Bitcoin’s energy-intensive model is the <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/2020/12/16/what-is-proof-of-work/">Proof-of-Work (PoW)</a> protocol. <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/how-does-bitcoin-mining-work/">Bitcoin mining</a>, the process of creating new Bitcoins using PoW, requires solving complex cryptographic equations to receive the rewards associated with the creation of the next block in the blockchain. PoW is carried out by computers, known as ‘miners’. </p>
<br/>
<p>In the early days, a simple computer was enough to mine Bitcoin. However, the difficulty of the mining algorithm increased as the network grew larger and more people started competing to earn the next block’s rewards. On average, it takes <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">about 10 minutes</a> to solve such an equation and to mine a new block. Today, Bitcoin mining has become a costly and elaborate endeavour – accessible only to large investors that can support powerful supercomputers – at the cost of <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/18/1049331/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-cryptomining-new-york/">local communities</a>.</p>
<br/>
<p>It’s only sensible that miners are beefing up their machines to increase their chances. In fact, the sector became so competitive that <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/sustainable-crypto-mining-becoming-reality-nameet-potnis/">Intel created</a> dedicated chips and specialized manufacturers for mining servers like <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.bitmain.com/">Bitmain</a> were established. With up to 3,250 Watts indicated by manufacturers, the power consumption of such devices averages 28,470 kWh per year if operated continuously. In comparison, the annual consumption of a freezer is estimated between 200 and 500 kWh per year. </p>
<br/>
<p>Additionally, operating a single mining machine is hardly the way to succeed. The biggest Bitcoin miners have fleets of hundreds of machines in so-called ‘mining farms’, carefully maintained and constantly ventilated, to prevent them from overheating. Some of the largest, like <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.rockdalemdd.org/news/whinstone-us-breaks-ground-build-world%E2%80%99s-largest-bitcoin-mining-facility-rockdale-texas">Northern Data</a> in Texas, have an energy consumption of 1 GWh per year, the equivalent of the energy produced by about <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/how-much-power-1-gigawatt">3.1 million</a> photovoltaic (solar) panels. </p>
<br/>
<p>In critical times where humanity is facing serious global challenges in relation to climate change and the collapse of biodiversity, we must rethink the basics of how to decentralize our world. </p>
<h2 id="are-there-more-energy-conscious-solutions">Are there more energy-conscious solutions?</h2>
<p><a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/2020/12/30/what-is-proof-of-stake/">Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</a> mechanisms have proven to be <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/how-does-bitcoin-mining-work/#toc-downsides-of-mining">less energy intensive</a> than PoW. With PoS, miners lock up (‘stake’) a blockchain’s cryptocurrency on escrow accounts to be granted mining rights. In exchange for this participation, miners receive an interest proportional to their stake as reward. </p>
<br/>
<p>PoS-based blockchains are faster and much more energy efficient than PoW-based blockchains. However, the implementation of a PoS protocol poses its own challenges. For example, it is known for incentivizing hoarding, rather than utilization, and driving centralization. The mining industry is attempting to shift perceptions and move away from its climate-polluting, power-hungry image by powering large mining activities with renewable energies or by offsetting their emissions with carbon credits.</p>
<br/>
<p>While this might sound great at first, it does not resolve the underlying issue of incredibly high energy consumption. Should we really allocate relatively scarce renewable energy resources to such energy-intensive endeavours? Or should we rather look for more efficient alternatives – considering we have all the technology to create more energy-efficient models from scratch – and then support what energy consumption remains with renewable energy? </p>
<h2 id="threefold-farming-offers-a-greener-paradigm">ThreeFold Farming offers a greener paradigm</h2>
<p><a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://threefold.io/blog/what_is_farming/">ThreeFold Farming</a> is a decentralized, energy-efficient and meaningful alternative to mining. <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/the-potential-of-the-threefold-token-tft/1796">ThreeFold Tokens</a> (TFT) are minted whenever new Internet capacity in terms of compute, storage or network is added to the ThreeFold Grid by connecting computers, known as 3Nodes. </p>
<br/>
<p>By contributing decentralized Internet capacity to the ThreeFold Grid, independent people and organizations called ‘farmers’ earn TFT in return – based on a <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/tfgrid/farming/threefold__proof_of_capacity?id=why-proof-of-capacity">Proof-of-Capacity</a>  (PoC) algorithm. PoC is autonomously carried out by ThreeFold’s <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://threefold.io/blog/for_our_planet/">extremely efficient</a> operating system. First, Zero-OS scans the computer’s resources. Then the operating system registers the computing power and Internet storage on the <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://threefold.io/blog/tf_chain/">ThreeFold Blockchain</a>, making the resources available to the entire network – thereby creating a <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://coincheckup.com/blog/threefold-is-the-decentralized-web-the-future-of-the-internet/">decentralized model</a> for Internet capacity provisioning. The <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://threefold.docsend.com/view/wsru3f9tmeaq62wq">energy consumption</a> of a 3Node can vary, depending on the amount of Compute Units (CUs) and Storage Units (SUs) it holds. “The average consumption for a Titan 3Node is around 26.71 KwH per hour”, says ThreeFold’s <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://threefold.io/people/alexandre_hannelas/">Alexandre Hannelas</a>. </p>
<br/>
<p>Farming supports the realization of an open-source peer-to-peer Internet free from centralized servers and authorities. Similarly to Bitcoin, the management of transactions and the issuing of TFT is carried out collectively by the network to create a decentralized Internet economy. In a way, what <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://threefold.io/blog/bitcoin_threefold/">Bitcoin did to money</a>, ThreeFold does to the Internet – while using much <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://threefold.io/blog/for_our_planet/">less energy</a>. </p>
<br/>
<p><em>“By using blockchain for what it’s good at and other pioneering technologies, such as peer-to-peer networking, to complement it, we built the most efficient Internet infrastructure in the world, and by far.” – Kristof de Spiegeleer.</em></p>
<br/>
<p>Developing sustainable solutions for our planet is essential to ThreeFold’s ethos which puts our planet and people first. A famous quote, we love and frequently refer to at ThreeFold, is Albert Einstein’s “We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we create them.”</p>
<br/>
<p>Our planet needs regenerative solutions at a large scale, and ThreeFold aims to deliver on our promise providing better solutions for our planet and people through our technology. Based on the ThreeFold Grid’s average energy consumption, we’re planting trees with our partner <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/driving-regeneration-with-tag/2120?u=hannahcordes">Take Action Global</a> to offset the Grid’s carbon emissions three times in the form of <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-on-track-to-be-planet-positive/2097?u=hannahcordes">Voluntary Carbon Credits</a> (VCC). Our VCC system was implemented in the PoC algorithm, so every 3Node mints additional TFT to offset its own carbon emissions based on the power utilization of the individual 3Node per month. The <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-on-track-to-be-planet-positive/2097">process</a> is fully automated and executed by the ThreeFold Blockchain.</p>
<br/>
<p>ThreeFold’s global community of farmers is on a mission to regenerate our planet through the planet-positive ThreeFold Farming which supports tree planting and other <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/supporting-initiatives-to-regenerate-the-planet/2110?u=hannahcordes">impact initiatives</a> by default. We’re on track to provide a planet-positive Internet and support our partners in their initiatives in fields like climate education, climate action and economic inclusion worldwide.</p>
<br/>
<p>Farming is about so much more than crypto mining. It’s about building a <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/authority-magazine/the-future-is-now-kristoff-de-spiegeleer-of-threefold-on-how-their-technological-innovation-will-7acc0e51c365">better Internet</a> and shaping the world we want to live in.
