          Today, the Internet is a ubiquitous part of our daily lives, and it continues to evolve. As we continue to innovate and collaborate, we can build a better, more secure digital future for all.

        <div class="article hidden"><p><em>“This article was originally published by Victoria Obeegadoo, a former member of ThreeFold Foundation.”</em></p>
<br>
<p>The Internet has undergone a natural evolution from its early days as a fragmented network of computers, to the vast interconnected web of infrastructure and platforms we know today. This has shaped the way we communicate, work, and live. With each passing decade, new technologies and protocols have emerged to address growing concerns about cybercrime, surveillance, and censorship. Let’s take a closer look at each phase of this evolution and how ThreeFold is taking action for the next step.</p>
<h2 id="1960s-to-1980s-internet-s-early-days">1960s to 1980s: Internet’s Early Days</h2>
<p>The Internet as we know it began as a project of the US Department of Defense’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in the 1960s, with the aim of creating a communication network that could withstand a nuclear attack. The network was designed to be decentralized, so that if one node was destroyed, the network could still function. The result was a decentralized system that allowed computers to communicate with each other over long distances, without relying on a central server.</p>
<br/>
<p>By the 1970s, the ARPANET (as it was then called) had grown to include dozens of nodes and was used by government agencies, educational institutions, and research organizations for communication and data sharing. However, it was still very much a fragmented network, and accessing information from one system to another was not easy. So, in the early 1970s, Ray Tomlinson developed the first email system, which enabled users to send messages between different computers on the ARPANET.</p>
<br/>
<p>In the late 1970s, the TCP/IP protocol suite was developed, which enabled computers to communicate across different networks and laid the foundation for the global Internet. This was the dawn of the peer-to-peer concept. In the early 1980s, the Domain Name System (DNS) was developed, which provided a way to translate human-readable domain names into IP addresses, making it easier to access websites and other resources on the Internet. Finally, in 1989, Tim Berners-Lee developed the World Wide Web, which provided a user-friendly interface for accessing and sharing information on the Internet.</p>
<br/>
<p>The early days of the Internet were a time of experimentation and innovation, as researchers explored new ways to connect computers and share data. This phase of the Internet was focused on building the underlying infrastructure of the network and establishing protocols for communication between computers.</p>
<h2 id="1990s-2000s-popularization-commodification-of-the-internet">1990s &amp; 2000s: Popularization &amp; Commodification of the Internet</h2>
<p>The 1990s marked a turning point in the Internet’s evolution. The World Wide Web became the primary way people accessed information and connected with one another online. This new platform, which allowed users to easily access and share information, changed the Internet’s use from an exclusive network for institutions and organizations to a tool accessible to the general public. As such, there was an explosion in its use, which allowed for the rise of e-commerce and online advertising – creating new business opportunities and changing the way we shop and consume media.</p>
<br/>
<p>The emergence of new ways to interact online in the 1990s and early 2000s further popularized the Internet. Companies such as Amazon, eBay, and Yahoo! capitalized on this trend, creating a massive online market for goods and services. The further commodification of the Internet led to the rise of tech giants like Google, Facebook, and Amazon.</p>
<br/>
<p>This phase of the Internet was thus marked by the consolidation of power in the hands of a few large companies who controlled the infrastructure and thus access to information and data. The introduction of social media created new ways for people to connect and share information, but it also enabled the spread of misinformation and misuse of data. Some companies began to build their businesses on the collection and analysis of user data to sell advertising, which started raising concerns about data ownership, privacy, and security.</p>
<br/>
<p>The 2000s also saw the rise of cybercrime and surveillance on the Internet. Cybercriminals began to exploit vulnerabilities in websites and software to steal sensitive information like credit card numbers, passwords, and personal data. Governments also started to monitor online activities in the name of national security. This led to the development of more advanced security protocols like HTTPS and VPNs to protect users’ privacy and data.</p>
<h2 id="2010s-the-age-of-big-data-and-social-media">2010s: The Age of Big Data and Social Media</h2>
<p>The 2010s saw the rise of big data and social media, which brought a new set of privacy and security concerns. Issues such as data breaches, cyber attacks, and online harassment were becoming increasingly common as the Internet continued to evolve. Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter collected vast amounts of data on their users, often without their explicit knowledge or consent. Governments continued to monitor online activities, and there were widespread reports of government surveillance and censorship.</p>
<br/>
<p>These issues led to a growing awareness of the need for a more secure and privacy-centric Internet. This phase of the Internet was marked by growing concerns about data ownership, privacy, and security. The <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-scandal-fallout.html">Cambridge Analytica scandal</a> and the <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/business/equifax-breach-settlement.html">Equifax data breach</a> are just a few examples of the risks associated with the commodification of user data. To combat these issues, new technologies like blockchain and decentralized networks began to emerge. These technologies promised to create a more secure and private Internet by removing centralized control and giving users more control over their data.</p>
<h2 id="2020s-so-far-a-shift-towards-privacy-and-sovereignty">2020s So Far: A Shift Towards Privacy and Sovereignty</h2>
<p>The 2020s have seen a growing movement towards creating a more private and sovereign Internet. With continued concerns about data breaches, surveillance, and censorship, there has been a growing demand for more secure and private online services. Many people have started to switch to privacy-focused services like Signal and ProtonMail, which offer end-to-end encryption and other privacy protections.</p>
<br/>
<p>Governments and tech companies are also starting to recognize the importance of privacy and sovereignty. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) are examples of legislation that aim to protect users’ privacy and give them more control over their data. Tech companies like Apple and Google are also introducing new privacy features in their products to give users more control over their data.</p>
<br/>
<p>We are now seeing the emergence of Web3 technology, which aims to create a decentralized Internet that is more secure and private. Web3 is built on blockchain technology, which allows for decentralized control and eliminates the need for third-party intermediaries. This technology also enables the creation of user-centric digital twins, which are unique digital representations of individuals that can be used to authenticate their identity and provide secure access to online services.</p>
<br/>
<p>Secure cloud technologies are also becoming increasingly important in the quest for a more secure and sovereign Internet. Cloud technologies provide scalable and reliable infrastructure for storing and processing data, but they also come with security risks. To address these risks, new technologies like confidential computing and secure enclaves are being developed to provide secure cloud environments that protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.</p>
<br/>
<p>Together, these emerging technologies are driving a paradigm shift towards a more secure, private, and sovereign Internet. While there is still much work to be done to address the challenges of cybersecurity and privacy in the digital age, these developments are promising signs that we are moving in the right direction.</p>

<p>Today, the Internet is a ubiquitous part of our daily lives, and it continues to evolve. As we continue to innovate and collaborate, we can build a better, more secure digital future for all. Already, we are seeing the emergence of new technologies, such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things, that promise to transform the Internet even further. As we move forward, we can expect to see more innovations and developments that aim to create a more secure, decentralized, and user-centric Internet that prioritizes privacy, data ownership, and security.</p>
<br/>
<p>On our side, at ThreeFold, we see that many of the solutions being presented today are mere band-aids, without addressing the root of the problems of what the Internet has become. Our founders, who were early Internet pioneers themselves, along with a dedicated team, are building the infrastructure for tomorrow’s Internet. One that takes inspiration from the early days. One that is decentralized, peer-to-peer, open-source, secure, private, and much more! We believe that putting people at the forefront of our project is crucial, and that protecting our planet’s resources while doing so is equally important. We have a project like no other, and if you believe in the evolution of the Internet towards more security, privacy &amp; sovereignty, we invite you to dive in to learn more.</p>

<p>The Internet has become one of the most important aspects of human life. Our everyday lives are impacted by social media and other online platforms on a very minute level. Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and others have become the most convenient way to stay in touch with friends and family. WhiteHart, Udemy and others have made quality education accessible to all. Swiggy, Zomato and others have made our favourite cuisine accessible at home. Amazon, Flipkart and others have grown the shopping experience for Indians with a variety of choices. Netflix, Hotstar, Youtube and others have made entertainment on demand easy for us.</p>
<br>
<p>Over the past decade, we have all gotten addicted to the comforts that the internet has brought to us, and it wouldn’t be wrong for us to say that we cannot imagine our lives without the internet.</p>
<br>
<p>While Indian internet usage ranks second in the world today behind China, with 43% of its total population online, this also means that there is still a lot of untapped potential in India.</p>
<h2 id="issues-with-current-internet">Issues with current Internet</h2>
<p>Although the internet has helped us in making our lives comfortable, there are several issues with the current Internet services we use. Some of them are mentioned below:</p>
<h3 id="cyber-security">Cyber security</h3>
<p>The cyber security infrastructure in India today is not well equipped to tackle increasing cyber-crimes. You may not have the resolution to your complaints filed with Cyber Cell Portals on time. Hence there is an increasing number of fraudsters and hackers in India.</p>
<h3 id="data-ownership">Data ownership</h3>
<p>Personal details shared by you on the internet are used by big companies to influence your decision-making process strategically.</p>
<h3 id="higher-cost-to-customers">Higher cost to customers</h3>
<p>Since internet infrastructure is owned and controlled by a few big companies, there is an irregular price increase which makes the internet unaffordable to many parts of rural India.</p>
<h2 id="decentralised-internet-is-the-solution">Decentralised Internet is the solution</h2>
<p>Decentralisation of the internet refers to the arrangement of the internet or its components such that no single entity or organization has control or authority over the network. It  holds the potential to revolutionize the way every nation accesses and utilizes the world wide web. India, one of the biggest players in the digital world, can greatly benefit from Internet decentralization. It would open up many new opportunities for both the country and its citizens.</p>
<br>
<p>To start, decentralization of the internet would give India more control over its digital landscape. Instead of relying on a single, centralized entity to power its network, India could decentralize its internet and make the administration of the network much more efficient. With this additional control and efficiency, India could develop a more secure and reliable infrastructure, while also controlling the delivery of services. This could lead to faster, more reliable connection speeds, along with increased safety and security.</p>
<br>
<p>Additionally, decentralization of the internet would allow India to establish itself as a technological leader. By decentralizing the internet, India could shift its focus from the existing internet infrastructure to developing innovative technology and applications. This could include the development of decentralized artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and much more. Potential applications of these technologies could drastically improve the education, healthcare, and transportation sectors of India.</p>
<br>
<p>Finally, decentralization of the internet could help with digital media access and distribution. This could open up new opportunities for providing access to digital media in rural areas, allowing for more effective access to education and entertainment. Furthermore, it could also provide access to more reliable payment services, as well as better consumer protection policies.</p>
<br>
<p>In conclusion, decentralization of the internet holds the potential to greatly benefit India and its citizens. It would give India control over its internet infrastructure, opening the door for development of innovative technologies and applications. Additionally, it could provide more effective access to digital media, along with more reliable payment services and consumer protection policies. In order for India to take full advantage of the potential of decentralization of the internet, it must take decisive steps towards implementing the necessary reforms and investments to ensure its success.</p>
<h2 id="how-threefold-can-contribute">How ThreeFold can contribute</h2>
<p>ThreeFold technology runs on the concept of a grid formed by farmers who are independent people, unlike big corporations, that connect their nodes anywhere network and electricity is present to create a global distributed internet infrastructure. This resolves the problem of monopoly and price of big internet companies.</p>
<br>
<p>The technology also ensures that you get data security which was how the internet was originally intended to be.</p>

          What’s happening with Twitter is just the latest warning of the dangers of the centralized Internet, and the fact that people are leaving is the latest signal that the world is increasingly ready for a decentralized digital world.

        <div class="article hidden"><h2 id="twitter-mastodon-and-why-we-re-evolving-the-internet">Twitter, Mastodon, and Why We’re Evolving the Internet</h2>
<p>With Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter becoming official at the end of October, many people have become uncomfortable with the idea of a single controversial billionaire with a lot on his plate having that level of power over a platform used by hundreds of millions of people worldwide – making decisions that look to be putting the company, the platform, and its users in jeopardy, at least in the short term.</p>
<br/>
<p>As a result of the acquisition and a series of events thereafter, millions of Twitter users have started looking for a replacement, with more than one million people flocking to the leading decentralized Twitter alternative, Mastodon, over the past two weeks.</p>
<br/>
<p><img src="https://dev.threefold.io/blogarchive/twitter-mastodon/./mastodon_users.png" alt="mastodon_users" /></p>
<br/>
<p>This is not the first time we’ve seen the alarm bells ring, a mass exodus from a top social networking site or communication platform. (And by the way, it won’t be the last.) As an example, last year after WhatsApp announced some changes to its terms of service, tens of millions of new accounts were created on Signal and Telegram. And earlier this year, Facebook reported a loss in daily active users.</p>
<br/>
<p>The reality is that most platforms are owned &amp; controlled by the few. And it actually goes further than just platforms: the way the infrastructure of the current internet model is built, its foundational layers, are controlled by the few as well. Think about it, as ‘users’ of platforms, browsers, websites, etc., we have become the product, or rather, our data has become the product.</p>
<br/>
<p>Targeted advertising, cookies, geo-localisation. Agenda setting might have been ignited in the newspaper industry hundreds of years ago, but it definitely reached the Internet. When you search for something on the web, through most browsers &amp; platforms, the outcomes you get are the result of an agenda setting. This means that a few decide which information is more important than the other. Often, this decision is subjective, and influenced by the highest bids to get on top of the list.</p>
<br/>
<p>What’s happening with Twitter is just the latest warning of the dangers of the centralized Internet, and the fact that people are leaving is the latest signal that the world is increasingly ready for a decentralized digital world. People aren’t just boycotting social media, they are leaving to go somewhere else considered ‘better’. They are migrating to Mastodon.</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="what-makes-mastodon-a-viable-alternative-to-twitter">What makes Mastodon a viable alternative to Twitter?</h2>
<p>Mastodon has a lot of the same functionalities as Twitter, such as replies, retweets, favorites, bookmarks and hash tags. However, it is not owned or operated by any one organization. Instead, it’s made up of lots of different servers (also called “instances”), all talking to one another. The service describes itself as a “federated network which operates in a similar way to email.” And as it is open source, Mastodon allows for anyone to download, modify, &amp; install Mastodon on their own servers. Pretty nifty, right?</p>
<br/>
<p><img src="https://dev.threefold.io/blogarchive/twitter-mastodon/./mastodon.png" alt="mastodon" /></p>
<br/>
<p>Mastodon was created in 2016 by German software developer Eugen Rochko. Unlike most popular social media sites, like Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn, Mastodon is a nonprofit. As such, its goal is to benefit the public rather than shareholders. Twitter has built up a reputation for being the “watercooler of the world”. While it would be quite a task for Mastodon to replicate that feat at scale, many people might prefer the latter for a number of reasons, like:</p>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Control over your timeline: No algorithm dictating what you’ll see – and no advertisements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not for Sale: “We will never serve ads or push profiles for you to see. That means your data and your time are yours and yours alone.” - Mastodon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freedom of moderation: Individual communities may create their own content guidelines, offering a variety of different user experiences. Join a server with the rules you agree with, or host your own!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decentralization: Each Mastodon server is a completely independent entity, able to interoperate with others to form one global social network. Anybody can deploy Mastodon on their own infrastructure, under no third-party control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open Source: Mastodon believes in the right to use, copy, study and change Mastodon as one sees fit, since everyone benefits from contributions from the community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interoperable: Built on open web protocols, Mastodon can speak with any other platform that implements ActivityPub. With one account, users get access to a whole universe of social apps—the Fediverse.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h2 id="how-do-mastodon-threefold-align">How do Mastodon &amp; ThreeFold Align?</h2>
<p>What is happening with Twitter is a reflection of the entire Internet model. Now, more and more people are opening their eyes to the shared fundamentals of decentralization and open source, which are paradigms shared by ThreeFold &amp; Mastodon.</p>
<br/>
<p>In a world where centralization is the default way of operating, we tend to be relatively oblivious to what it entails. Being part of a centralized Internet ultimately makes us dependent on the relative few that dictate our digital lives. By moving away, through decentralization, we can take control of our digital lives again.</p>
<br/>
<p><img src="https://dev.threefold.io/blogarchive/twitter-mastodon/./twitter_vs_internet.png" alt="twitter_vs_internet" /></p>
<br/>
<p>Mastodon and the whole Fediverse have already attracted incredible communities with similar values and mindsets as that of ThreeFold and our community. Everyone joining Mastodon is looking for decentralization – whether they know it or not. Really, this mass exodus from Twitter is more proof (a la people leaving Facebook in droves or moving from WhatsApp to other messaging tools) that the world is increasingly ready for decentralization and what ThreeFold enables.</p>
<br/>
<p>Leaving Twitter for Mastodon is a step in the right direction, but if you are really alarmed by what has been happening with this Twitter saga, we are here to invite you to take action and be a part of a better Internet system. We can build this together!</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="how-can-threefold-support-mastodon">How can ThreeFold support Mastodon?</h2>
<p>ThreeFold provides a reliable decentralized infrastructure that Mastodon and the rest of the platforms within the Fediverse need, and we believe that those communities will be very interested in our broader vision as well.</p>
<br/>
<p>The ThreeFold Movement is collectively building an Internet by the people for the people, from the infrastructure level up to the experiences. You can plug in hardware, join the ThreeFold Grid, and provide decentralized Internet capacity for the communities around you.</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>ThreeFold offers three main solutions to the growing Mastodon community:</strong></p>
<br/>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Deployment</strong>: ThreeFold is making it very easy for anyone and everyone to create their own server through the ThreeFold Playground, so they are in full control. And it’s on decentralized infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>True Co-Ownership</strong>: We’ll make it possible to co-own communities via smart contract, so if some nodes leave or go offline, the server is still viable. So any group of people can chip in some money and co-own your own Mastodon server. By creating your own community, as of Grid 3.8, you will also be able to ask people for contributions in order to operate the server, etc. And you can set and maintain your own moderation standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>More Flexible (Secure) Login</strong>: Lastly, we’re going to focus on authentication. Today it’s only email based, which means it’s easy for people to hide. ThreeFold could enable different verification options – email-based, TF Connect, and even TF Connect + KYC. So each server can have their own standards.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<h2 id="what-is-threefold-already-doing-to-make-this-happen">What is ThreeFold already doing to make this happen?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Currently the team is working on an easy-to-deploy weblet so that anybody can easily launch their own instance of Mastodon running on top of the ThreeFold Grid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating a plan for people to be able to <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/how-to-deploy-mastadon-on-the-threefold-grid-today/3487">deploy their own Mastodon servers</a> for free.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building a website re: Mastodon + ThreeFold.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reached out to the Mastodon team (We have done this officially, but we can do more of it from more angles).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating plenty of content on the <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/c/threefold-grid-utilization/fediverse/113">forum</a> (e.g. open letter to Mastodon community), posting on social media, finding and engaging with public conversations about Mastodon on Twitter (something we can all do).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We held a Community Call around Mastodon &amp; the Fediverse to discuss in further details what has been mentioned in this blog. Find a recording of it <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/mastodon-the-fediverse-community-call-recording/3522">here</a>!</p>

<p>Greetings fellow decentralization lovers, I am in search of people looking to contribute to what is now the largest decentralized network in the world, working towards the goal of providing a decentralized internet that breaks down barriers to information and compute resource access. Our network provides digital equality to all users while placing the control of their data back into their hands.</p>
<br>
<p>The project I’m discussing is <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://threefold.io/">Threefold.io</a>, this is a project that currently has nearly 3000 Bare-Metal** **nodes in 64 countries allowing anyone in the world to deploy an industry standard VPS on the decentralized infrastructure with no involvement of the centralized cloud providers, This is a network meant to be used by everyone that can be expanded by anyone. You can check out a current map of the nodes online on the <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://dashboard.grid.tf/explorer/statistics">ThreeFold Explorer</a></p>
<br>
<p>The ThreeFold Grid consists of three synergistic layers: The Nodes, The Network, and the BlockChain.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Nodes:</strong> These are hardware that gives its grid its power, The requirements for running a 3Node are a bare metal x86_64 machine and a reliable internet connection. These nodes can be hosted in a variety of environments spanning at home deployments to rented-space DC’s. This includes DC’s themselves being able to bring capacity online so long as it’s a fully bare metal device.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can find <strong><em>plug and play solutions</em></strong> for bringing a 3Node online on the [3Node marketplace](https://marketplace.3node.global/index.php?dispatch= categories.view&amp;category_id=167), this marketplace includes node offerings from both the organizations itself as well as multiple independent businesses that have become certified 3Node Resellers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you’re familiar with the concepts of building a server/pc you can also bring your hardware online as <strong><em>D.I.Y 3Node</em></strong> this allows you to contribute any additional hardware you may have in your deployment to the support of both the grids network and compute capacity. you can find documentation on D.I.Y nodes on the <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/diy-nodes-guide/837">Forums</a> or in the <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/tfgrid/farming/threefold__diy_guide">Wiki</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each node is booted using a fully in house developed autonomous operating system that automates both node deployment and workloads being deployed on the node after its online, called <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://github.com/threefoldtech/zos">Zero-OS</a>. This OS is a hypervisor environment that accepts commands from and is managed by the block-chain.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Network(s):</strong> The grid is supported by multiple internal and external networks that allow for the nodes to function as a decentralized data center. This is made of two major components.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Z-Net</strong>- is an internal private overlay network between VMs, Kubernetes Nodes, Containers and the grid. This network allows for minimal usage of Public ipv4 space while still allowing for global deployment solutions encompassing multiple 3Nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Planetary Network-</strong> This is a peer to peer end to encrypted network solution based on opensource technologies (yggdrasil) that allow grid users to create, develop and overlay networks designed to protect users ability to communicate and access information. You can find the github Repo <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://github.com/threefoldtech/planetary_network">here</a>, with 3000 endpoints all controlled by a single DAO, the potential exists to create the most reliable peer to peer mesh in existence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Public IPv4-</strong> Threefold farmers have the ability to add Public Ipv4 to the grid in addition to their compute capacity, these IPs can be deployed as gateway addresses in support of the grid, or rented by end users for their workloads, at the time of this writing the threefold grid has 1114 Public Ipv4 addresses available for use. you can find documentation on adding I.P addresses to the grid <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/diy-public-node-guide/3340">here</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The BlockChain:</strong> the blockchain technologies built into the Threefold Grid represent what makes the grid truly unique and allows it to be utilized to support customer facing workloads or provide a decentralized compute resource pool. grid utilization is supported and created through two avenues</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Individuals:</strong> can deploy any workload they need on any node on the grid, if it can run on Linux it can run on the grid, this type of use is supported by the <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://play.grid.tf/#/">Threefold Playground</a>, a decentralized deployment solution that provides industry standard Linux vps deployments as multiple use case specific deployment solutions for <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://caprover.com/">Caprover</a>, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://joinpeertube.org/">Peertube</a>, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://funkwhale.audio/">Funkwhale</a>, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://mattermost.com/">Mattermost</a>, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a>, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.taiga.io/">Taiga</a>, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://owncloud.com/">Owncloud</a>, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://presearch.io/">Presearch</a>, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://subsquid.io/">SubSquid</a>, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://casperlabs.io/">CasperLabs</a>, and <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://nodepilot.tech/">Node Pilot</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Custom VM images cab be uploaded to the <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://hub.grid.tf/">Threefold Hub</a> allowing full deployment customization with any Linux os image supporting cloud-init. Documentation on creating custom images can be found <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/manipulating-cloud-images-for-the-grid/3380">On the Forums</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Storage workloads can be deployed using <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://github.com/threefoldtech/terraform-provider-grid">Terraform</a> with offerings of HDD, SSD and <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://github.com/threefoldtech/terraform-provider-grid">Quantum Safe File Storage</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Solution Providers</strong>: these are developers of user facing services that utilize the grid as their hosting platform. These organizations/individuals are able to develop customized solutions that provide needed services in their market and receive rewards for the utilization that their developments bring. A great example of this is <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://zonaris.con/">Zonaris</a>, which is a third party organization that is quickly taking the lead in grid solution development. They have recently released an interface that allows end users to deploy <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://streamr.network/discover/network/">Streamr</a> nodes on the Threefold grid while paying in fiat currency. you can get started with them at <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://get.zonaris.com/">Get Zonaris</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This allows developers to invest in only their code while having the infrastructure of a worldwide virtual data center at their disposal to scale their solutions with their business needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solution providers are able to automate their tools being deployed on the grid using <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://github.com/threefoldtech/terraform-provider-grid">Terraform</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>What this has all truly come together to form is an organization where anyone can contribute to building a more private and secure internet that is designed to allow universal access to information and compute power regardless of the end user’s nationality or beliefs. Threefold truly exists to capitalize on the ideal economies from every corner of the world, in order to provide a better digital future for all.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p>
<p>Much of what you see today at Threefold.io is the work of 100s of decentralized contributors working together towards a common goal. The grid is designed so that anyone can contribute whether you’re a developer, a property owner, an I.S.P, or just someone with a spare computer and a network connection. As it stands the grid is strong and well supported across the world. The biggest impact that can be made today is by developing solutions that leverage the grid and use its resources to bring affordable and accessible hosting to end users.</p>
<br>
<p>There are many discussions happening on the <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io">Threefold Forum</a> about partnerships with other projects and how we can better support both the crypto landscape and the general internet user base. Even by just joining discussions on the Threefold Forum and providing your input and ideas you can help to make sure that the internet of tomorrow is built for and by the users of tomorrow. but there are lots of ways to contribute:</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-digital-twin">What is a Digital Twin?</h2>
<p>In the current Internet system, each of us exists many times, each application provider owns <em>our</em> data while offering functionality <em>they</em> own. We become the user. We become the product. Instead, what if we were at the center of our digital lives?</p>
<br>
<p>The Web4 Digital Twin architecture does just that: it puts us at the center of our digital experience. Indeed, Digital Twin is a user-centric technological platform to build efficient, sovereign and secure digital experiences. Digital Twin technology empowers people and businesses to exchange information and value without any intermediaries, while making applications more scalable, efficient and secure than on any other web paradigm such as Web2, Web3 or Web5. Digital Twins require a decentralized Internet infrastructure and run perfectly on top of the ThreeFold Grid.</p>
<h2 id="your-digital-twin-is-a-mirror-of-yourself">Your Digital Twin is a mirror of yourself!</h2>
<p>Your Digital Twin runs on a location of your choice, which becomes your personal Internet Gateway. Each Twin is owned by only one owner, who in the end is more like the human mirror to the Twin. The Twin has lots of capabilities and is available for its “human mirror” 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Experiences are being built which use the capabilities of the Twin. A Twin owns your data and your identity, all stored in such a way it can never be corrupted or lost. Thus, you own your data, your identity and your digital skills for all your life.</p>
<h2 id="your-digital-twin-has-capabilities">Your Digital Twin has Capabilities</h2>
<p>Twins are powerful and have many capabilities which are used when they enter an experience. Here are the capabilities of the Digital Twin:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicate
<ul>
<li>Chat, video conference, send messages to anyone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create
<ul>
<li>Create content, any content (metaverse, video, websites, …)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Share and Promote
<ul>
<li>Share your creations to the rest of the world</li>
<li>Promote your products and services</li>
<li>Share your knowledge and help others to grow</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Discover and Learn
<ul>
<li>Find information, alternative indexing engine (neutral)</li>
<li>Know what is truthful and what is not (proof of authenticity)</li>
<li>Learn and become smarter</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Economy
<ul>
<li>Manage my digital wealth (digital currencies)</li>
<li>Exchange anything for anything else (money for tokens, services, products)</li>
<li>Buy/Sell goods and services</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Collaborate
<ul>
<li>How can I collaborate on documents, images, videos, code, …</li>
<li>How can I manage a project, plan events, define deadlines</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Organize
<ul>
<li>Manage your agenda and time</li>
<li>Organize your digital content so you can find it back, and it’s nicely organized</li>
<li>Manage your circles (groups of people)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Protect
<ul>
<li>Make sure that only the right people have access to your digital assets</li>
<li>What happens if you die, make sure your loved ones can inherit your digital assets</li>
<li>Make sure your digital life is secure (give access to your assets to your circles)</li>
<li>Give proof of authenticity to assets and information from others</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Develop and Expand
<ul>
<li>Code and extend the Twin (improve Twin capabilities for yourself and others)</li>
<li>Create your own experiences</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>The Twin has basic capabilities listed above which are strongly version controlled, but contributions from the global community are more than welcomed. The idea is to create a system which is simply good enough for any possible experience.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="https://dev.threefold.io/blogarchive/digital-twin/./your_digital_twin.png" alt="Your Digital Twin" /></p>
<br>
<p>This is a very different paradigm compared to current web or mobile applications where capabilities are owned by the provider of the application. Besides, rather than survival of the fittest, we believe in a system of collaboration, where we invite everyone to make the system better so it fits us all. We don’t need three chat systems, we need one which is usable by thousands of experiences.</p>
<br>
<p>Developers can create experiences re-using the open source capabilities the Twin offers, also eliminating the need to reinvent features.</p>
<h2 id="note-on-connection-security">Note on Connection &amp; Security</h2>
<p>As a “user”, you can use any browser to access experiences built on top of your Digital Twin. For example, a storage experience that stores data on your Twin or a browser experience that allows you to surf the web from your Twin’s node. When you connect to your Twin, our <strong><a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/web4/threefold__threefold_connect">ThreeFold Connect</a></strong> makes sure that the connection is secure. The Twin runs on a node on the ThreeFold Grid, which you are securely connected to. This takes care of a very safe approach and unlimited scalability. We will dive deeper into the Twin’s security and scalability aspects in a future blog!</p>
<h2 id="digital-twin-in-a-nutshell">Digital Twin in a nutshell</h2>
<p>Hopefully, by now you will have a better understanding of the Digital Twin concept. Here is a short recap of everything mentioned so far about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have full control over your own digital life.</li>
<li>Experiences can be created using standard web &amp; native technologies.</li>
<li>The Digital Twin delivers the web interface to your (secure) browser.</li>
<li>No need for information to travel to central data centers, all communication is fast and private between Digital Twins: No more client-server.</li>
<li>All logic of your digital life is 100% private to you running in your Twin.</li>
<li>This is super efficient and sustainable, +10x power savings.</li>
<li>No blockchain required for your digital life = more privacy, performance, green
<ul>
<li>Exception: blockchain is needed for digital currencies and as a phone book for Digital Twin’s identity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-is-testing-so-crucial">Why is testing so crucial?</h2>
<p>ThreeFold created an open-source peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure that offers a place for developers, end-users and everyone in-between to collectively build an open digital world with full digital sovereignty. We seek to re-imagine business, governance, finance, education and more to build a better future for all.</p>
<br>
<p>This future can only be achieved with the collaboration of a strong, healthy and dedicated community. One of the key challenges for a project like ours is the continuous testing and improving of new features as well as building all of the applications and solutions we’d like to see to enhance and grow the ecosystem. Community contributions are the heart and a crucial driver of the growing ThreeFold movement – a global movement that is open and decentralized, meaning it is up to each and everyone of us to push things forward.</p>
<br>
<p>No matter your experience level, from developers to end-users and everyone in-between, there are options for you to contribute to ThreeFold. Whether you’re more tech-savvy and would like to develop solutions on top of the Grid and test tech features or rather help us improve the manuals and spread the word, there are many ways to take action and support the movement.</p>
<br>
<p>A reliable, open-source peer-to-peer infrastructure together with a growing community of enthusiastic, driven developers and end-users are the key to accelerating the growth and development of the Grid and to unlocking all of its potential. And the more people believe in ThreeFold and our Internet of Internets vision, the sooner we can bring digital sovereignty, empowerment and meaningful experiences to the world.</p>
<h2 id="why-should-you-join-threefold-s-tester-community">Why should you join ThreeFold’s tester community?</h2>
<p>So why get involved in ThreeFold? Well first of all, you can join an engaged, open movement that seeks to shape the future we want to live in and provide better solutions for our planet and people. You can meet, exchange and collaborate with people from all over the world that share similar interests and values.</p>
<br>
<p>You also learn new skills and get to know some innovative technology that enables you to build and test pretty cool applications and solutions – like deploying a Subsquid instance on the <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://play.grid.tf">ThreeFold Playground</a> or checking out the different decentralized alternatives to solutions we use every day like WhatsApp, YouTube, Chrome or Zoom with <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://demo.freeflow.life">FreeFlow Twin</a>. Our open, friendly and skilled community can offer you support and advice as you start testing and building. Let’s help each other and build cool stuff together!</p>
<h2 id="the-threefold-community-where-ideas-come-to-life">The ThreeFold Community – Where ideas come to life</h2>
<p>Curious about what fellow community members are building on ThreeFold? Here are a few recent examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teisie has been working on a few great tools to make things easier for his fellow ThreeFolders like an iOS app for node monitoring and a geo explorer. Moreover, he’s been working on an uptime tool and deployment calculator – hosted on the Grid and using Drew’s gateway node for public access. Learn more <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/teisies-uptime-tool-and-deployment-calculator/3384?u=hannahcordes">here</a>. Well done, Teisie!</li>
<li>Another skilled community member building on the Grid is Drew. With his <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/cockpit-managed-ubuntu-vm/3376?u=hannahcordes">community project</a> for a Cockpit management interface, he provides a web-based interface for managing a VM that allows users to do a lot of maintenance tasks without ssh – even including full remote desktop capabilities from the browser. Pretty cool, right?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Start exploring and using the many solutions on the ThreeFold Grid today – whether by deploying a weblet, testing the FreeFlow Twin or simply joining our testing group!</p>
