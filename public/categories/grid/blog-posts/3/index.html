          P2P systems are network, not linear or pyramidal hierarchies (though they may share some elements)..

<p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) is a term that originated from the distributed computer application architecture where tasks and workloads are shared between peers, popularized by <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster">Napster</a>, a revolutionary file storing system from the late 1990s.
<br/>
<br/>
The concept inspired new structures and philosophies in many areas of human interaction. P2P systems and groups are typically critical of authoritarian and centralized social structures and believe in equality, meritocracy, flat systems, participatory &amp; circular economies, as the concept represents a concrete pathway to these outcomes or visions.
<br/>
<br/>
P2P systems are network, not linear or ‘pyramidal’ hierarchies (though they may share some elements). They are ‘distributed’, though they may have elements of ‘centralization’ and ‘decentralization.’ And intelligence is not located at any center, but everywhere within the system.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-threefold-relate-to-peer-to-peer"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#how-does-threefold-relate-to-peer-to-peer" aria-label="Anchor link for: how-does-threefold-relate-to-peer-to-peer">🔗</a>How does ThreeFold relate to peer-to-peer?</h2>
<p>ThreeFold’s Peer-to-Peer (P2P) computing network is a distributed architecture that splits tasks and workloads between its peers, ThreeFold Farmers. Farmers are equal participants in the network and together they form a peer-to-peer network of nodes, the ThreeFold Grid.
<br/>
<br/>
Farmers make their resources, such as processing power, disk storage or network bandwidth, directly available to other network participants, without the need for central coordination by servers or stable hosts. Farmers are both suppliers and consumers of resources, in contrast to the traditional <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-server">client-server</a> model in which the consumption and supply of resources is divided.
<br/>
<br/>
In the near future, ThreeFold will create Digital Twin, which will go beyond the era of peers doing similar things while sharing resources. It will actually enable much more than that. Digital Twin will create a complete new digital world with diverse peers that can bring in unique resources and capabilities to a <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_community">virtual community</a> on the ThreeFold Grid. This will empower the network of peers to engage in greater tasks beyond those that can be accomplished by individual peers, and are beneficial to all the peers.</p>

<p>Everything starts (or should start) from the why, and the ThreeFold story started a long time ago. Before the inception of ThreeFold, many of the co-founders of the project used to work with the largest IT &amp; Cloud actors. Throughout their experience working in the Industry, they realized that the complexity of the technology and the centralization of knowledge &amp; power led to an inefficient, unsustainable, not scalable and unequally distributed infrastructure. So they decided to redesign the whole Internet and cloud infrastructure bottom-up with the vision of shaping a global internet economy that can scale anywhere efficiently, cost efficiently and sustainably. </p>
<h2 id="why-does-the-world-needs-peer-to-peer"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#why-does-the-world-needs-peer-to-peer" aria-label="Anchor link for: why-does-the-world-needs-peer-to-peer">🔗</a>Why does the world needs peer-to-peer? </h2>
<p>By developing the technology, the conviction that peer-to-peer was the best solution for humanity and the planet strengthened itself. Why? Well, put simply, a peer-to-peer system removes all forms of intermediaries, unnecessary steps and complexity from the picture. Therefore, it simplifies the architecture in an incredible way. The benefits are many but here are the most popular benefits:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li><em>Privacy</em>: Our peer-to-peer environment means no middlemen or intermediaries, meaning data travels directly between peers and stored on the nodes of their choice rather than being sent through and stored by a third party.</li>
<li><em>Security</em>: Data stored in data centers is susceptible to security breaches. In bypassing data centers and exchanging data directly between peers, we can achieve much greater security as it reduces code and back doors significantly. </li>
<li><em>Scalability</em>: In a many-to-many system, scale is essentially unlimited. There is simply no bottleneck. And hardware (nodes) can be added at ease compared to current data center model.</li>
<li><em>Cost-efficiency &amp; Sustainability</em>: End-to-end (direct) connection between peers means a more efficient path for data and less energy is needed. Less energy means less cost, and less harm to our planet.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Peer-to-peer systems, like ThreeFold’s decentralized network, represent a transformative step towards a more efficient, secure, and equitable digital world. By removing intermediaries and relying on distributed resources, P2P networks offer unmatched privacy, scalability, and sustainability. As the world continues to evolve, embracing peer-to-peer solutions will be essential for building a fairer, more resilient digital infrastructure—one that empowers individuals and communities to thrive without relying on traditional centralized models.</p>

<p>Classic IT infrastructure setup is complex and is not cost-effective. Applications need a specific environment to operate in, built by integrating different technology components from different vendors. Elements of such a setup are operating systems, storage systems, networks, security systems, authentication systems, and more.<br />
<br/>
<br/>
Putting components together is called (system) integration, and integration requires agreement on how these components will fit together and the knowledge to do it.
<br/>
<br/>
This complexity and need for integration originate from the way the IT industry historically developed. With time more and more layers appeared to bring new possibilities. Additional layers masked existing problems. Instead of fixing the underlying issues, several third parties needed to be involved, adding complexity and increased costs (such as license costs, upgrades, updates, etc.). Complexity has become a business model.</p>
<h2 id="where-can-we-get-inspiration-to-do-it-a-different-way">Where can we get inspiration to do it a different way?</h2>
<p>What if we could build IT architectures in a different way.  What if we would not accept component solution approaches anymore and start over with a completely blank sheet of paper?  Would we then come up with a different way of actually building automation, architectures, and business models?</p>
<h3 id="looking-at-nature-for-inspiration">Looking at nature for inspiration</h3>
<p>Let’s start by looking for inspiration in nature. Suppose we consider IT systems to be a complex system. Are there parallels that we can draw between systems that exist in nature (and have evolved and improved over thousands of years) and those within the IT industry?
<br/>
<br/>
In nature, we see two kinds of systems (societies): centralized and decentralized systems.  Examples of centralized systems are herds, groups, or schools of animals living together where there is a hierarchy in the way they organize themselves. For decentralized systems, we can look at beehives and anthills.  Organizing efforts and benefits are distinct and come at a different cost.</p>
<h3 id="centralized-systems-in-nature">Centralized systems in nature</h3>
<p>In centralized systems, there is governance of activities, wealth positions, and so forth.  Think of a group of lions or chimpanzees.  There is always an alpha male who is dominant in the whole group.  He is the only that enjoys all of the benefits because the entire group/structure works towards his wishes.  He gets to mate with most female group members because the system believes that he has the strongest genes to help the group to survive in the future. The dominant male also gets most of the food gathered by the group, and if he doesn’t get it, he will claim it by showing his dominance and fight for it.  All the others are working towards this alpha male, and all the other males in the group will occasionally challenge the alpha male for dominance.<br />
<br/>
<br/>
This is very similar to how the IT industry has been operating to date:  there are a few alpha males in the industry - one for each sector that can be recognized (for example, in the Cloud Industry, you have Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and on the system integration front you have Dell, Siemens, CA Technologies).  They end up with the majority of businesses available in their specific markets. When challenged by new companies, they fight them (in every way possible, including killing them or acquiring them). And in analogy to the animal group, these alpha male companies have a lot of organizations that work with them, usually called “partners” or “channels.”</p>
<h3 id="decentralized-systems-in-nature">Decentralized systems in nature</h3>
<p>For decentralized systems on <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralised_system">Wikipedia</a>, we learn; “One of the most well-known examples of a “natural” decentralized system is one used by insect colonies such as Ants. In these insect colonies, control is distributed among the biological agents who act upon local information and local interactions to create complex and universal behavior collectively. While individually exhibiting simple behaviors, these agents achieve universal goals such as feeding the colony or raising the brood using dynamical mechanisms like non-explicit communication and exploiting their closely coupled action and perception systems. Without any form of central authority, these insect colonies achieve their universal goals by performing required tasks and by responding to changing conditions in their external environment. They also adjust the number of workers performing each task to ensure the completion of all tasks. For example, ant colonies guide their global behavior (in terms of foraging, patrolling, brood care, and nest maintenance) using a pulsing, shifting web of Spatio-temporal patterned interactions that rely on antennal contact rate and olfactory sensing. While these interactions consist of both interactions with the environment and each other, ants do not direct the behavior of other ants. They thus never have a “central controller” dictating what is to be done to achieve global goals.“
<br/>
<br/>
So nature has provided us with solid examples of centralized and decentralized systems.  For much of what works in the modern world, we have ended up using the centralized model governing enterprises and countries.  Various industries have also adopted the centralized model where there is a pyramid structure, and everything works towards the alpha males.</p>
<h2 id="a-different-approach-to-creating-and-operating-it-workloads">A different approach to creating and operating IT workloads</h2>
<p>What if we can develop a new concept for creating, deploying, and operating IT workloads.  What if we say goodbye to the centralized way of controlling IT workloads.  Can we develop an idea that works in a decentralized way?</p>
<h3 id="the-concept">The concept</h3>
<p>To build this concept, we will draw the use of the human way of operating a large ship. The crew of a vessel has different roles, which we will call the <em>coordinators</em>. Some of these coordinators could be a captain, officers, engineers, and oilers.  These coordinators have in-depth knowledge of their specific tasks but usually lack a detailed understanding of the other roles. In the “hive” of a ship, the specific requests to get tasks done are sent to coordinators who will receive, interpret, execute their particular tasks, and report the (non-) progress of these tasks or subtasks.  For example, the captain will create and agree to a schedule of maintenance tasks for the engine room. These are daily, weekly and monthly tasks that should be completed by the engineers and oilers. The engineers and oilers do not get continuous input from the captain. They get one instruction to follow the schedule and know what needs to be done for every task. The intermediate state (what is complete and what still needs to be addressed) is stored by the coordinators executing the tasks. This is the most efficient way of accomplishing tasks.</p>
<h3 id="jumping-to-the-it-industry">Jumping to the IT industry</h3>
<p>If we bring this concept to the IT world, we conclude that today’s IT systems are built in a significantly different way.  Most architectures (if not all) have a central facility that stores <em>all</em> information and <em>all</em> states of activity in a so-called central ‘database.’ A general norm within IT. However, these types of architectures are inefficient and are very complex - like the ship analogy -  a central command room (database) is created where every coordinator needs to report back. (1) The current level of activity, (2) the completion (state) of tasks, (3) the proper understanding of upcoming tasks by the coordinator to accomplish tasks in-progress or future - hence leading to the undesirable outcome of complexity due to centralization.
<br/>
<br/>
In the ship example, we deem this type of functioning/workflow inefficient; however, in the IT world, it is a common way of doing it.  Furthermore, IT infrastructures usually have different databases to store “state” in different parts of the IT architecture.  The analogy would translate to different command rooms that orchestrate different functions on the ship in our ship. This, in turn, introduces the need for another role in starting coordinating between the different command rooms to ensure that all information is shared and communicated. Taking this pattern forward leads to an endless loop of adding interfaces, layers, bridges between different parts of the system that all store information, multiple times, and in different ways.</p>
<h3 id="datastores">Datastores</h3>
<p>By design, a decentralized IT  architecture should not use centralized data storage (databases) for multiple tasks (roles). It instead should feature a similar approach to the way of functioning as in the ‘ship’ example. In this architecture,  roles get short and precise instructions of the jobs to be completed and autonomously execute.  We call these execution engines <em>coordinators</em>.  Coordinators receive instructions, run on instructions and store all information about the current task <em>locally.</em>  They store all the relevant information in a local storage facility (available to the individual coordinators only) and provide information about the state of execution if and when other coordinators ask for a state update.</p>
<h2 id="magical-coordinator">Magical Coordinator</h2>
<h3 id="requirements-to-let-actor-based-management-work">Requirements to let actor based management work</h3>
<br/>
<br/>
* Less complexity
<ul>
<li>
<p>State only with the actor itself (no-where else !!!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understood language between actors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Process = recipes of a cook, NOT IN A DB
<br/>
<br/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="actor-based-it-solutions">Actor based IT solutions</h2>
<p>To simplify common IT architectures, we should look at a   new way of creating such a system that takes the current standards into account:
<br/>
<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No people involved in integrating different components into a single solution</p>
<ul>
<li>Which, as a consequence, means no revenue generation based on creating and managing complexity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>No central state / operational data storage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individual automated actors with specific knowledge for specific tasks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Independent operating actors completing specific tasks
<br/>
<br/>
Such a system should ideally be owned by many (not just a single organization, bringing centralization back into the equations) that operate IT tasks for many.  We have not seen such a system in existence, but we are as TFTech building and rolling out technology that can do this.
<br/>
<br/>
We believe that IT’s future is in decentralization where specific coordinators (bots) will roam a network of capacity looking for a task to do, making themselves available where needed, creating more of them when the system grows, and allowing the global population to deploy and operate IT workloads.</p>

          ThreeFold&#x27;s Long Story Short
        </h3>
        
        <p class="mt-3 text-sm font-normal text-gray-500 text-left">
          The truth is that ThreeFold is a big project. Here we will try to make things a little simpler for you.
        </p>
        
        <div class="article hidden"><h2 id="so-threefold-is-building-a-new-internet-why">So, ThreeFold is building a new internet. Why?</h2>
<p>We strongly believe that a new internet is needed for our planet and for humanity. “If not now, when? If not us, who?”
<br/>
<br/>
What it boils down to is that currently the internet is only available to about 1/2 of the world (meaning billions are being left behind), it is centralized (a handful of large corporations own and profit off of our data), and it uses up to 10% of the world’s energy consumption. So, we’re building a new (peer-to-peer) internet that empowers equality (access), autonomy (data ownership, for example), and sustainability (reduces energy consumption). These values drive us forward.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>
<p>Everything on the internet – websites, apps, photos, videos, etc – uses up capacity and is stored in huge data centers owned by big companies, mainly in North America, Europe, and some in Asia. In our solution, centralized data centers are replaced with a grid of “nodes” distributed around the world.
<br/>
<br/>
These nodes are owned by <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold/#/what_is_farming">ThreeFold Farmers</a> – but only the physical hardware – the data inside of the nodes belongs to the people or organizations who put it there. So, “farmers” plug in hardware and start to create capacity that can be used by people.
<br/>
<br/>
Farmers come in all shapes and sizes. Some farmers run small data centers while others simply run a node out of their living room.
<br/>
<br/>
When Farmers connect active hardware (add capacity) to the ThreeFold Grid, ThreeFold Tokens are created. Farmers can then sell those tokens to people who want to use capacity (e.g. a developer that wants to build or host a website, or a person who wants to store some photos). More on tokens down below.</p>
<h2 id="seems-quite-lofty-how-will-you-build-it">Seems quite lofty. How will you build it?</h2>
<p>It’s true that rebuilding the internet is not so simple. But a lot of infrastructure has already been built and the technology is quite advanced. Over the past 2+ years (as of May 2020), independent ThreeFold Farmers have already plugged in more than 40,000,000 GigaBytes worth of storage and 15,000 CPU Cores across 21+ countries. That might not mean a lot to non-technical folks but it is quite a significant amount.</p>
<h2 id="21-countries-what-happened-to-equality">21+ countries? What happened to equality?</h2>
<p>As far along as we are, we still have work to do. One of our biggest goals in the near future is to expand the grid to Africa, South America, and parts of Asia where currently the Internet is too expensive or not available. Currently, we farming is incentivized around these key geographies.</p>
<h2 id="and-what-do-you-mean-by-peer-to-peer">And what do you mean by peer-to-peer?</h2>
<p>Peer-to-peer means no middlemen – direct exchange of information and/or value between equal participants. Peer-to-peer means decentralization – breaking away from pyramid-based systems, greed-based systems – and putting <strong>people</strong> back in the center of their own (digital) lives.</p>
<h2 id="so-how-can-i-access-use-your-internet-today-what-can-i-do-on-it">So how can I access / use your internet today? What can I do on it?</h2>
<p>By June, some of the first experiences will be live. This includes file storage and communication tools and a virtual browser, all with the advantages of being more sustainable for our planet and with full control of your own data. And over time, more and more experiences will come to this internet. We’ll be updating here and on our communication platforms as they come. But don’t worry, as a user it doesn’t change much – no coding required. :)</p>
<h2 id="will-enter-website-or-app-here-be-available-on-your-internet">Will [enter website or app here] be available on your internet?</h2>
<p>There are some tremendous reasons for a website or app to use our internet, but that will really be up to the website or the app. In the end, we are providing a responsible solution for responsible people and organizations. We would love to host anybody who believes in what we are doing!</p>
<h2 id="how-are-you-making-sure-it-s-safe">How are you making sure it’s safe?</h2>
<p>Hacking has become a part of life and is almost impossible to avoid in the current systems – they are too complex and require too many people to operate. This results in less security which results in lots of security breaches. We took a look at the existing Internet (seven layers) and simplified it down to three layers. By simplifying the architecture and instead creating technology that is self-driving &amp; self-healing, we removed the human requirement and therefore vastly minimized the possibility for hacking or human error. Then we also developed a storage algorithm which makes it such that if some of the information gets lost or stolen (somehow) or if some hardware goes down, it is all retrievable. Long story short, we flipped the existing system on its head.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-the-data-ownership-part">What about the data ownership part?</h2>
<p>That has a bit to do with the security as well. Since you own your data, you decide who gets access. Which means your data isn’t just out “there” for the taking. Basically, we put you at the center of your digital life, where the applications and experiences you use serve you, not the other way around.</p>
<h2 id="and-how-is-it-better-for-the-planet">And how is it better for the planet?</h2>
<p>There are a few reasons for us being more sustainable. Data centers are super unsustainable, so the simple (but incomplete) answer is “no more huge data centers.” But if you want more detail:
<br/>
<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>We use up to 3x less hardware for the same output, and using hardware at least 2x longer while maintaining good performance</li>
<li>Having capacity everywhere, local to where users are – this reduces network requirements (and can even improve security)</li>
<li>Using new algorithms (e.g. the one mentioned above for storage) which have dramatic efficiency improvement</li>
<li>Re-using hardware where possible – let’s not throw away</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-much-will-it-cost">How much will it cost?</h2>
<p>In the end we want to provide sustainable access to the internet and all of its solutions for less than a dollar per month per person but for now the cost will depend on what you choose to do. Certain experiences will cost money. Storing photos or videos, for example. But all at a fair price.</p>
<h2 id="speaking-of-money-so-what-s-up-with-the-threefold-token">Speaking of money – so what’s up with the ThreeFold Token?</h2>
<p>As we mentioned above, tokens are generated when ThreeFold Farmers adds capacity to the ThreeFold Grid.</p>
<p>Essentially, the ThreeFold Token is the medium of exchange on the new internet. So, if a developer wants to build something (e.g. a website or an app) or a user wants to store something (e.g. photos), he/she/they use(s) ThreeFold Tokens.</p>
<h2 id="need-more-answers">Need more answers?</h2>

<p><em>The ThreeFold Foundation has created end-to-end technology that creates a very stable digital currency with neutral, private and distributed capacity generating hardware as a financial backing mechanism.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-ecosystem">The ecosystem</h2>
<p>The ThreeFold Ecosystem is a token economy where tokens (digital currency) are being generated (and therefore financially backed) by internet capacity generating equipment, owned by anyone and housed anywhere. By building and creating internet capacity owned and operated by all of us, we can create wealth and business opportunities for anyone in the world. Also, this sets the foundation for a more stable digital currency to emerge.

          The internet is growing at an extremely fast pace, but is that a good thing?
        </p>
        
        <div class="article hidden"><p><em>This article was originally published by Andreas Hartl, a former member of the ThreeFold team.</em></p>
<br>
<p>The current growth of internet needs 4000+ new large scale data centers of computer systems. The global data growth will reach more than 40 Zetabytes by 2020 which represents an average yearly growth of 42% starting at 4.5 Zetabytes in 2013. To host all this data, over 4000 new big data centers have to to be built. And to achieve this goal, $ 1 trillion USD investment capital is needed and land totalling the size of the UK would be needed.
<br/>
<br/>
The Internet is one of the fastest growing industries in the world. In this article we’ll explain why that’s not always such a good thing and where we see opportunities.</p>
<h2 id="internet-capacity-needs-to-become-localized">Internet capacity needs to become localized</h2>
<p>A big majority of users in the world connect to servers that are not present in their region and as such experience higher costs and low performance. According to a study by datacentermap.com, 80% of the data centers of the current Internet’s service providers are based in the U.S. and Europe. The rest of the world has scarce Internet resources dotted around territories.
<br/>
<br/>
As a consequence most Internet users use Internet-based services running on infrastructure which is located far away from their physical location and most likely outside their country’s borders. This decreases the general end-user experience (latency) but also adds unnecessary costs to transporting the information back and forth. Also, it adds legislation and compliance headaches to enterprises.
<br/>
<br/>
Our mission is to empower and inspire people to recognize abundance by living new experiences one hour at a time.</p>
<h2 id="the-internet-needs-to-perform-better">The Internet needs to perform better</h2>
<p>Compute and Storage vendors create poor-performing solutions. There have been yearly improvements in hardware following Moore’s law. While this has allowed ThreeFold to progress and innovate, it has also led to software developers taking these advances for granted; cutting corners where they can, creating sub-optimal code and allowing software components to be layered on top of each other to achieve certain behavioral functionalities.
<br/>
<br/>
The inefficiencies have now led to a situation where organically-grown IT architectures are immensely complex. They use a variety of components from different software and hardware vendors integrated by so called ‘integrators’. The overall effort and cost involved to create, operate and maintain such architectures is growing continuously and requiring an ever-increasing budget and resourcing to continue.
<br/>
<br/>
If we could go down to the core algorithms and take another look at these, and innovate at the heart of technology instead of applying patches and pain killers, we would be able to create much more end-user capacity than what systems provide today. Systems will last longer and will not have to be replaced by faster ones. Also, fewer engineers will be needed to create, operate and maintain these systems. Combined, these elements would present a more stable and reliable platform that can achieve higher levels of uptime.
<br/>
<br/>
Only upsides, right? Well a huge downside of such an approach is that vendors will make less revenue and more importantly less margin as systems will run for longer, be more stable and require less updates. So why would vendors innovate at the core of their solution?</p>
<h2 id="the-internet-needs-to-become-more-sustainable">The Internet needs to become more sustainable</h2>
<p>Did you know that the current Internet is responsible for between 5 and 10% of global energy consumptions? Making it more harmful to our planet than the airline Industry. The good news is that we can achieve 10x more power efficiency by addressing certain areas such as storage.
<br/>
<br/>
ThreeFold believes IT can do a much better job at being more sustainable - in fact ThreeFold believes it can reduce the Internet’s carbon footprint by 10 times compared to other industry standards in IT capacity producing solutions.
<br/>
<br/>
Power consumption is a function of better compute and storage performance that in theory would require more racks and cooling. ThreeFold’s architectural approach brought solutions that enables it’s Farmers to achieve roughly 3 times the performance per rack (so it uses fewer racks) and the racks require less energy than typical racks in the industry.
<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="the-internet-needs-to-become-more-affordable">The Internet needs to become more affordable</h2>
<p>The biggest cost in running IT architectures is the human cost. Today’s complex systems, built out of ‘band aid and patches’ point solutions, organically-grown and badly documented IT infrastructures, need an armada of people to keep them ticking. Even though this is an example, one can learn a lot from the trends that are presented:
<br/>
<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>On average an IT budget takes 5% of overall revenues</li>
<li>IT consumes 6.5% of the total number of Full-time equivalent in the company, of which 85% are insourced and 15% on payroll. This means that the enterprise doesn’t retain internal know-how to operate their IT.</li>
<li>About 50% of IT budgets are spent on Infrastructure ane operations. Similarly, a big part goes to applications. A mere 5% is considered to be internal overhead within the IT department.</li>
<li>Around 65% of the IT budget is spent on resources and services, around 35% is spent on hardware and software.
<br/>
<br/>
These figures present industry average numbers and paint a troubling picture that IT is a sizeable part of an overall budget, and that most spending is going to have the right knowledge skills insourced to the organisation to run the core IT architecture it relies on. For any other discipline in any organisation this would present an unacceptable risk to the business and its continuity - strangely not for IT.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-internet-needs-to-become-self-healing">The Internet needs to become self-healing</h2>
<p>The biggest source of downtime in computer systems is people. Getting people involved in fixing infrastructure problems creates the risk of accidentally causing more system downtime. A very recent example on this hit a large organisation cloud service provider.
<br/>
<br/>
20+ years ago when Internet data centers came into existence next to telecom points of presence (POP), the level of complication in architecting, and building and maintaining these infrastructures exploded. From an already reasonable complicated technology setup to transport packets of data around the globe, these information warehouses were created where data was uploaded to, processed, and the obtained results sent back to end users on the other side of the globe.
<br/>
<br/>
Managing a data center that contains solutions for information transportation, storage and processing is not an easy task and the growth of data volume uploaded, stored and processed has exponentially increased. The number of technologies invented and implemented in regards to the processing and storing of information has also exploded. This resulted in a double exponential growth in complexity to architect, build, operate and maintain these IT systems.
<br/>
<br/>
The time has come that we no longer rely on people to do the right thing in case of emergency - the complexity is overwhelming and the dependency on the availability of that information is huge. Having people to do manual deployments and operational responsibilities does not provide the agility and speed to keep up with the continuous exponential growth of the industry. It is time to take the human element out of IT and let smart and autonomous systems to take over. This will also let people focus on more creative activities.</p>
<h2 id="the-world-needs-a-responsible-internet">The world needs a responsible internet</h2>
<p>On a humanitarian level the opportunities for creativity, learning and development are currently negatively influenced by a lack of access to performant and affordable Internet services. Since <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/un-says-internet-access-is-a-human-right-2016-7#:~:text=Due%20to%20the%20lack%20of,20.">Internet access is a human right</a>, it should protect the status quo between the developed and less-developed regions of our world.</p>
<h2 id="the-internet-is-growing-fast-with-the-wrong-solutions">The Internet is growing fast, with the wrong solutions</h2>
<p>It is evident that the current solutions are super unsustainable and make no sense. Luckily, ThreeFold and many other start-ups are deploying new solutions.

<h3 id="any-docker-service">Any Docker Service</h3>
<p>ThreeFold nodes natively run containers - therefore they can run any Docker service.  But it does so in a more efficient way than the current Docker engine - the most used and known container technology platform in the world.</p>
<h3 id="iaas">IAAS</h3>
<p>The ThreeFold node technology enables hardware capabilities to be used for IAAS services in a very efficient way.  Overhead is reduced to a minimum by stripping out unnecessary layers of software that have been implemented over the last decade to patch scaling and performance problems. Our engineers have always looked at the root cause of issues and by innovating at the core algorithm level, solved many issues.
Examples are:
<br/>
<br/></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Less is more</strong>: Scale down the operating system for a virtualization architecture to a minimum and boot it over the network - no local operating system files installed on local storage.</li>
<li><strong>Look at root causes, no painkiller approach</strong>: Step away from existing storage solutions that require proprietary acceleration hardware and use standard off the shelf, affordable and efficient components with a 100% software-based storage solution that can withstand hardware failures without requiring human intervention - creating a very efficient, reliable and performing storage solution that can operate standalone.
<br/>
<br/>
The platform is secured by using a network boot mechanism that makes it virtually hack resistant as there are no operating system files installed locally. Infrastructure as a service traditionally runs in hyper-scale data centers, remote from the businesses using it. ThreeFold node technology allows you to install, operate and run IAAS services close to your business locations operated by your local IT team.  It operates on a peer-to-peer network - only transferring bits of data that need to be transported to avoid network congestion and traffic bottlenecks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="archive">Archive</h3>
<p>Data generation is growing exponentially. More data has been generated in the last 2 years than ever before. This creates a big need to archive data. The ThreeFold node technology creates storage and archiving capabilities by using standard hardware and known interfaces (S3, FTP, WebDav, CIFS, and NFS) will be built by developers worldwide and made available.  The low-level storage functionality supports version controlling of the archived data, which keeps all relevant changes without any limitation by using a small amount of actual storage capacity.</p>
<h3 id="security">Security</h3>
<p>Data security and reliability are key aspects of any storage system.  The ThreeFold node allows all data to be compressed and encrypted if and when needed. The distributed character of the storage system enables site redundant storage algorithms to be deployed while keeping large data volumes from being stored in a single location. This removes the risk of data being stolen (physically) and prevents a site outage to result in data outage.  The distributed character of the system is in line with the increasing spread of actual data generation.  ThreeFold has sensory equipment everywhere these days, and the overhead of storing all that information in a few central places is enormous. Data collection and storage happens once - reading data to use it for a particular workload happens many times.</p>
<h3 id="data-mining">Data Mining</h3>
<p>On traditional server architectures, every application has to set up its servers that run their code in isolated silos, making sharing of data hard. The distributed character of the ThreeFold node technology presents compute and storage capacity everywhere.  This enables large data mining workloads to happen close to the source of the data.  By storing data in a distributed manner, mining can be distributed as well. Distributed compute capacity next to storage capabilities creates the possibility to create data mining operations on local storage (which makes it very fast and efficient) by coding data mining algorithms in programming languages (such as Python, Lua, Javascript, and Golang). Data mining follows distributed data storage.
<br/>
<br/>
Never run into scalability problems again with the ThreeFold node. Data storage can expand horizontally using thousands of distributed nodes to create large storage volumes.</p>
<h3 id="smart-contracts">Smart Contracts</h3>
<p>Smart contracts are applications that run on a decentralized platform, exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party interference. These applications run on a blockchain, a powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of that value. Smart contracts enable developers to create markets, store registries of debts (or promises), move funds following past instructions (like a will or a futures contract), and many other things without a middleman or counterparty risk.  ThreeFold nodes run based on smart-contracts.</p>
<h3 id="self-learning-and-ai">Self-Learning and AI</h3>
<p>Blockchains can be seen as databases. By current database standards, traditional blockchains like Bitcoin are terrible: low throughout, low capacity, high latency, poor query support, and so on. But even with these terrible characteristics, blockchains introduced three new and important characteristics:
<br/>
<br/></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decentralized data and shared data control</strong>  leads to more data and better qualitative data which results in better models. Shortening the machine learning time also enables AI to progress at a faster pace.</li>
<li><strong>Immutable audit trails</strong> improve the trustworthiness of the data, and improves the models’ provenance on training and testing results.</li>
<li><strong>Native assets</strong> and assets exchanges make training and testing models intellectual property (IP) assets easier - enhancing decentralized data and model exchanges.
<br/>
<br/>
Blockchain technology allows more and better quality data to be presented to machine learning algorithms.  It has been proven (Microsoft researchers - Banko and Brill) that more data — not just a bit more data but way more data — while using the same algorithms results in a lot better machine learning.  Meaning that the future of machine learning is not in trying to create more sophisticated algorithms (which will happen). So by moving AI learning into a blockchain environment we speed up machine learning and in the end create AI.</li>
